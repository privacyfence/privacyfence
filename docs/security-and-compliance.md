# Security and compliance

This document describes the security controls implemented by PrivacyFence. It is a technical control reference, not a certification statement.

## Security model

PrivacyFence mediates MCP access to connected third-party services. The daemon, policy engine, approval UI, connector credentials, organization configuration, and audit log are part of the trusted computing base.

The primary goals are:

- do not release protected provider data before the configured policy permits it;
- require explicit human approval for operations configured to require review/confirmation;
- keep connector credentials and user-scoped state out of MCP-visible content;
- keep principals isolated in org mode;
- fail closed on invalid security configuration;
- preserve enough audit evidence to reconstruct policy/approval decisions.

These goals describe what the controls are built to do. How far each one extends depends on the
deployment mode — see [Local-mode trust boundary](#local-mode-trust-boundary) for where the approval
and fail-closed goals stop in local mode, which is the default.

## Deployment model

PrivacyFence runs in one of two deployment modes, chosen by IT when the daemon is configured — not
something an individual user or the AI can switch. In **local mode** (the default), one instance
runs on one employee's own machine, with a single implicit principal authorized by a random secret
written to local state; there is no sign-in. In **org mode** (opt-in), IT operates a shared
instance, typically on Ubuntu (see [`org-mode-setup-guide.md`](org-mode-setup-guide.md)), and each
person authenticates via OIDC against the organization's own identity provider — a browser session
and an MCP client's OAuth 2.1 token issued for the same sign-in resolve to the same principal.

Neither mode runs on PrivacyFence-operated infrastructure: local mode runs entirely on the
employee's device, and org mode runs on a server the organization itself provisions and controls.
There is no multi-tenant service and no PrivacyFence API that connector traffic passes through —
every tool call reaches the underlying provider (Google, Slack, Salesforce, Atlassian, Telegram)
directly from that machine or server.

## Local-mode trust boundary

**In local mode the trust boundary is the operating-system user account.** The daemon, its state, the
browser session and the AI client all run as the same user on the same machine, so a process running
as that user can reach everything the approval UI depends on. This section states plainly what that
does and does not mean, because the goals listed above are otherwise easy to read more broadly than
they hold.

A local process running as the signed-in user can:

- connect to the control channel under the data directory's `authority` subdirectory ([#428](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/428)
  Phase 1 split this, and `config/settings.yaml`, enrolled WebAuthn credentials, and the audit log,
  out of the rest of the data directory; Phase 2 replaced the persistent `web_token` file and its
  `POST /api/bootstrap` HTTP route with a Unix domain socket (macOS/Linux) or an ACL'd named pipe
  (Windows) — a *different interface* than a browser can reach, but still no security gain on its
  own, since it still sits at the same uid as everything else there) and mint a fresh bootstrap
  code — the not-authorized page prints that exact command, deliberately, for a locked-out human;
- exchange the code for a `pf_session` cookie by visiting `/approvals?bootstrap=<code>`;
- `POST /api/approvals/<id>/decide` and release a pending approval.

No browser is involved at any step. The CSRF double-submit and same-origin checks on that last
request are defenses against a hostile web page loaded in the user's browser: such a page cannot read
the session cookie's value to echo it back, and cannot forge an `Origin` header. Neither constrains a
local process, which holds the cookie and sets its own headers. The same distinction applies to every
other control on this path — the bootstrap code's short TTL, its single-use consumption, and the
session's idle and absolute expiry all limit how long a *leaked* credential stays useful, not who may
mint one.

This matters more here than it would in most single-user software, because the process most likely to
do it is the one PrivacyFence exists to govern: an MCP client with shell access on the same machine is
the normal local-mode install.

**What the approval gate does defend against in local mode:** an AI client acting through `/mcp`
alone; mistakes and unattended drift; a remote attacker without code execution on the machine; and a
hostile web page in the user's browser. Those are real, and they are what the gate does day to day.

**What it does not defend against in local mode:** a local process, running as the signed-in user,
acting deliberately. Treat the approval gate there as a workflow control with a strong audit trail,
not as a boundary against local code execution.

**Org mode does not share this**, for a structural reason rather than a difference in checks: the
daemon runs on a server the organization operates, so an AI client on an employee's device has no
loopback access to it, no control channel to reach and no bootstrap endpoint to call —
`privacyfence_get_sign_in_link` raises there outright. Authentication is IdP-backed, and where
configured, WebAuthn step-up binds a write approval to a fresh user-verified assertion.

**Closing this in local mode** takes two changes, both tracked: running the daemon under its own
account so its state is neither readable nor writable by processes running as the user
([#428](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/428) — Phases 1 and 2, a state-layout
refactor and the control-channel interface itself, have landed; Phase 4's actual privilege
separation is what closes this), and giving the human a way into the web UI that does not route a
credential through the AI client ([#427](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/427)).
Local-mode WebAuthn step-up ([#426](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/426))
depends on both: a passkey enrolled in a credential store the agent can rewrite is not a control.

## Authentication boundaries

### Local web UI

The local browser UI is not authenticated by a reusable token in the URL. The daemon uses a one-time bootstrap exchange to establish an HttpOnly session cookie. Browser requests are then authenticated from that session.

Mutating requests require the authenticated session, same-origin checks, and CSRF validation. Session/bootstrap secrets are not intended for logging or propagation into connector data.

### MCP-issued sign-in links

`privacyfence_get_sign_in_link` is a meta-tool, available over `/mcp` like every connector tool, that mints a fresh bootstrap link for this same local web UI (`/approvals` or `/settings`) and returns it to the calling MCP client. It is dispatched directly rather than through the gated-call path every connector tool uses — deliberately: the human approval that path would require lives behind the very UI a locked-out user is trying to reach, so gating this tool on that UI would be circular.

What bounds it instead: local mode only (it raises in org mode, which authenticates through IdP-backed OAuth rather than a bootstrap link, so it can never return a working credential there); the link it mints is the same single-use, short-lived bootstrap code every other sign-in path in this section uses, consumed by the first visit whether or not it succeeds; `page` is allowlisted to `approvals`/`settings`, never an arbitrary path; and the local web UI is bound to `localhost`, so the link is only useful from the same machine the MCP client and daemon are already both running on. Every call is written to the audit log under its own `sign_in_link_issued` decision, carrying the calling client's self-reported reason — the same disclosed-and-unverified posture every other tool's `reason` parameter has.

Net effect: an MCP client can obtain a working session for the human-facing approval/settings surface without a human first approving that specific request. The justification this paragraph used to give — that such a client already holds equivalent-or-greater access via every other tool this daemon exposes — holds for connector reads and writes, which are themselves gated. It understates one case: a session also reaches the approval UI, so it can *release* a gated call rather than merely request one, and that is the product's central control rather than one more tool. This is not a weakness introduced by this tool — see [Local-mode trust boundary](#local-mode-trust-boundary), where a process running as the user mints the same session through the control channel without it — but it should not be described as a neutral consequence of existing trust either. Like every tool over `/mcp` (meta-tools included), it is advertised with the same uniform read-only/non-destructive annotations regardless of this real effect — see [`TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md#meta-tools) for why those are MCP UI hints, not a security boundary, and [issue #46](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/46) for the broader question of whether that uniform advertisement should change.

### Local MCP

The local `/mcp` endpoint uses the generated bearer token stored in the user's PrivacyFence state so local MCP clients/shims can authenticate independently from the browser session.

### Org mode

Org mode authenticates human users through the configured OIDC provider and applies PrivacyFence's org authorization/session model to MCP and web traffic. Principal identity is carried explicitly through request handling and user-scoped storage/connector resolution.

Where configured, WebAuthn step-up is used for sensitive org-mode approval actions. Credential enrollment and lookup are scoped to the authenticated principal. By default, step-up accepts either a passkey assertion or a fresh IdP re-authentication; `step_up.require_passkey` ([#406](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/406)) closes the IdP-reauth path for organizations that want hardware-bound WebAuthn as a hard requirement — a compromised or phished IdP session can no longer satisfy step-up on its own, and a principal with no enrolled passkey is hard-failed toward enrollment rather than silently allowed through the weaker path.

## Authorization and principal isolation

Local mode has one principal for the daemon instance. Org mode supports multiple principals and maintains user-scoped state under principal-aware paths.

`ConnectorRegistry` creates/caches connector hosts per principal. Service authorization callbacks evict the affected principal's cached connector host so subsequent calls use the updated credentials.

Org approval routes filter/authorize by principal rather than exposing the local-mode all-pending-approvals view across users.

## Approval and policy enforcement

Tool calls pass through the common gate before connector execution where required by policy. A user decision is bound to the pending request; stale/already-resolved approvals are not reusable as fresh authorization.

Always-allow rules are explicit scoped policy objects, not global bypasses. Rule matching is documented in [`always-allow-rules-reference.md`](always-allow-rules-reference.md).

Policy denials and unattended-mode restrictions fail before protected connector results are released.

These are enforcement properties of the gate itself. In local mode they bind an AI client acting
through `/mcp`; they do not bind a local process that reaches the web UI directly — see
[Local-mode trust boundary](#local-mode-trust-boundary).

## PII and content privacy

Provider content can be inspected for PII before release. Organization policy can allow, redact, or block configured categories. Invalid policy values are rejected instead of falling back to permissive behavior.

Preview and scan paths are bounded to avoid unbounded processing of provider-controlled content. Structured file parsing uses dedicated extraction code and hardened XML parsing where applicable. See [`file-type-support.md`](file-type-support.md) and [`pii-detection-keywords.md`](pii-detection-keywords.md).

## Credential and secret handling

Connector OAuth/session credentials are stored in PrivacyFence state, not returned through MCP tools. File creation/update paths that contain credentials use the repository's secure file helpers and restrictive permissions where the operating system supports them.

The self-hosted live-provider test runner keeps its real QA connector credentials outside GitHub-hosted runners and outside committed repository content. See [`connector-live-check-setup.md`](connector-live-check-setup.md).

Each connector's OAuth client secret is shared across every user of a given deployment rather than issued per-user: it authenticates the PrivacyFence installation to the provider, not an individual end user. A leaked client secret should be rotated with the provider directly; PrivacyFence itself has no per-secret rotation schedule or automated rotation mechanism.

## Organization configuration trust

Org-mode configuration is validated before use, including the configured trust/signature model for organization bundles. Startup should fail when required trust/configuration fields are absent or invalid rather than silently switching to a weaker mode.

Operators should protect the org configuration/trust material as deployment configuration and control who can replace it.

## HTTP security controls

The embedded web application applies security headers and CSP. Inline script/style elements required by the generated UI use per-response/content nonces rather than broad unsafe-inline allowances.

Browser sessions use HttpOnly cookies and same-origin/CSRF checks for state-changing operations. Sensitive bootstrap/bearer material is not intended to be carried in persistent browser URLs.

Deploy org mode behind the configured HTTPS reverse proxy and preserve the Host/origin assumptions documented by the setup guide.

Org mode's OAuth dynamic client registration (DCR) endpoint bounds its own resource usage: it caps the total number of registrations it will hold at once, validates registration metadata against a size limit, and prunes stale/expired registrations on an age-and-count basis rather than retaining them indefinitely.

## Download staging

Org-mode files that cannot be returned inline can be staged as encrypted temporary content and served from an opaque short-lived download token. Staged-link lifetime and inline-size thresholds are configurable and validated.

See [`org-mode-download-delivery.md`](org-mode-download-delivery.md).

## Audit integrity and forwarding

PrivacyFence records gate/approval activity in its audit log, including principal information in org mode. Every entry is unconditionally chained to the one before it with a keyed hash (HMAC-SHA256) — this isn't an opt-in feature; `AuditLogger` computes it for every install, and `verify_chain()` (or `scripts/verify_audit_log.py`) detects a line inserted, edited, or removed after the fact.

The chain's signing key lives next to the `.jsonl` files it protects, at the same file permissions. That defends against accidental corruption and against a party who gains write access to the log files specifically (e.g. a bug in some other export/backup path) without also reading the key — it does **not** defend against a party who already has full read/write access to the audit directory, since that party can read the key alongside the log and recompute a consistent chain over a tampered file. The real defense against that threat is a copy that leaves this trust boundary entirely — see the forwarding paragraph below. In local mode that party includes any process running as the signed-in user (see [Local-mode trust boundary](#local-mode-trust-boundary)), so forwarding carries more of the weight there than the file permissions do.

Org deployments can use the implemented forwarding/export path for external retention/monitoring. Forwarding does not replace local operational decisions about retention, backup, and access control.

Treat audit data as sensitive: it can reveal which services/tools/resources were used even when protected content itself was not released.

## Dependencies and supply chain

Runtime/test/build dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`, with release/dependency audit workflows under `.github/workflows/` and lock/update tooling under `requirements/` and `scripts/`.

CI includes dependency auditing and static analysis in addition to the normal test suite. Ruff and Bandit are blocking in the test workflow; mypy is informational there unless workflow configuration changes.

Each tagged release build generates a CycloneDX software bill of materials (SBOM) alongside the packaged artifacts.

Release artifacts use the platform signing/notarization paths described in [`platform-support.md`](platform-support.md).

## Operational security

Back up only the state your deployment needs and protect backups equivalently to the live credentials/configuration they contain. Restore procedures must preserve file ownership/permissions and should be tested on a non-production copy.

PrivacyFence uses a single-instance file lock via `portalocker`; one state directory should not be actively served by multiple daemon processes at once.

For centralized deployments, availability depends on the operator's service/reverse-proxy design. PrivacyFence itself is not a clustered shared-state service.

See [`org-mode-operational-readiness.md`](org-mode-operational-readiness.md).

## Testing evidence

Current automated security evidence includes unit/integration tests, browser/CSP tests, coverage-floor enforcement, static analysis, Python compatibility checks, scheduled live-provider checks, and release/platform smoke coverage described in [`testing-policy.md`](testing-policy.md).

What is deliberately left to human judgment rather than automated, and why, is in [`testing-policy.md`](testing-policy.md)'s "What deliberately remains manual".

## Vendor risk criteria

PrivacyFence has no certified information security management framework (e.g. ISO 27001), no
Business Continuity Plan, and no contractual risk-response process or SLA. This is a structural
consequence of the deployment model above, not an oversight:

- **Certified information security framework:** none — there is nothing to certify, since there is
  no PrivacyFence-operated infrastructure (see Deployment model above). Such certifications attest
  to controls around *operated* infrastructure, which doesn't exist here.
- **Business continuity plan:** none — there is no PrivacyFence-operated service whose outage could
  disrupt a deployment. If the maintainer became unreachable, already-installed copies keep running
  exactly as before; the code being open source lets an organization audit, fork, or maintain a
  pinned version independently of the original maintainer.
- **Risk response process / SLA: None.** Reports are handled best-effort, not against a committed
  response time — see [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for how to report and what to expect.

None of this changes the technical risk profile described elsewhere in this document — no vendor
infrastructure in the data path, no new data processor, human-in-the-loop enforcement on sensitive
calls, and a local audit trail. Organizations evaluating PrivacyFence against a standard
vendor-risk questionnaire should treat the absence above as a risk-acceptance decision, not a
security gap: approve it through a risk-acceptance/exception process rather than a standard
vendor-security sign-off, pin deployments to a specific reviewed release rather than auto-updating,
and assign an internal owner to track new releases and patch or roll back if a report doesn't land
in time.

## Vulnerability reporting

Report suspected vulnerabilities to **info@privacyfence.eu**, or use GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting from this repository's Security tab, rather than a public issue. See
[`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for the full disclosure process, what to include in a report, and
scope.

## Compliance positioning

PrivacyFence provides technical controls that can support an organization's privacy/security program, including approval gates, PII filtering, principal isolation, secure credential handling, audit logging, and controlled deployment configuration.

Whether a deployment satisfies a particular regulatory, contractual, or certification requirement depends on the organization's configuration, infrastructure, policies, identity provider, retention practices, operational procedures, and independent compliance assessment. The repository documentation should not be read as claiming certification by itself.
