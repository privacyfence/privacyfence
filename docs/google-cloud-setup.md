# Google Cloud Console Setup

This guide walks through creating a Google Cloud project, configuring OAuth, and enabling the APIs that PrivacyFence's Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Apps Script connectors require. If your organization also does Workspace room/resource booking, there's a second, separate project involved — see "Room directory sync" below.

Google is organization-level config: **one IT admin does this once**, packages the result into PrivacyFence's organization config bundle, and distributes it. Individual users never touch the Google Cloud Console — they just click **Authenticate…** in PrivacyFence Settings and sign in with their browser.

---

## For IT admins (once per organization)

### 1. Create a new project

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in.
2. Click the project selector at the top of the page → **New Project**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. `privacyfence`) and click **Create**.
4. Make sure the new project is selected in the project selector before continuing.

### 2. Enable required APIs

Open **APIs & Services → Library** and enable each of the following APIs one by one. Use the search box to find them.

| API name | Library search term | Used by |
|----------|--------------------|---------| 
| Gmail API | `Gmail API` | Gmail connector |
| Google Drive API | `Google Drive API` | Drive connector |
| Google Docs API | `Google Docs API` | Drive connector (`drive_write_doc_content`, `drive_docs_edit_content`, `drive_docs_format_content`) |
| Google Sheets API | `Google Sheets API` | Drive connector (`drive_sheets_*`) |
| Google People API | `People API` | Contacts connector |
| Google Calendar API | `Google Calendar API` | Calendar connector |
| Google Tasks API | `Tasks API` | Google Tasks connector |
| Apps Script API | `Apps Script API` | Apps Script connector (`apps_script_get_content`, `apps_script_write_content`, `apps_script_get_execution_log`) |

For each: click the API in the search results, then click **Enable**.

> **Note:** The People API covers Google Contacts. Do not confuse it with the older Contacts API, which is deprecated.

> **Note:** The Sheets API doesn't need its own OAuth scope or consent-screen entry — it accepts the same `drive` scope already granted, so users don't re-authenticate. It still has to be individually **enabled** in this project's API Library like every other API here; if it's left disabled, `drive_sheets_*` calls fail with an `accessNotConfigured` / "API has not been used in project ... before or it is disabled" error even though the user's OAuth token is otherwise valid.

> **Note:** This project deliberately never requests Admin SDK / Workspace-directory scopes. `calendar_list_rooms` (room/resource booking) is served from a static room directory synced separately — see "Room directory sync" below — precisely so that the OAuth client every employee authorizes day to day can never read the Workspace directory.

> **Note:** The Apps Script API is the one API in this table that enabling here is *not* sufficient for. Each individual user must also turn on **Google Apps Script API** at [script.google.com/home/usersettings](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings) — a per-user switch Google keeps entirely separate from this project's API Library, and off by default. Until they do, every `apps_script_*` call fails with a 403 (`User has not enabled the Apps Script API`) even though the project has the API enabled and the user's OAuth token is otherwise valid. It costs one click, but nothing in the Cloud console surfaces it, so include it in whatever setup instructions your users get.

> **Note:** The Apps Script connector also requests a narrow `drive.metadata.readonly` scope (name/id/timestamps only, never file content) purely to list a user's own standalone script projects — the Apps Script API itself has no "list my projects" endpoint. It runs no script code: there is deliberately no `run`/execute tool. See `apps_script_client.py`'s module docstring.

### 3. Configure the OAuth consent screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose **Internal** if you're on Google Workspace (so only your organization's accounts can authorize), or **External** for a personal Google account. Click **Create**.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **App name:** `PrivacyFence` (or any name you prefer)
   - **User support email:** your email address
   - **Developer contact information:** your email address
4. Click **Save and Continue**.
5. On the **Scopes** step, click **Save and Continue** — you do not need to add scopes here; they are requested at runtime.
6. If you chose **External**, add every user who will use PrivacyFence as a **Test user** on that step (or submit the app for verification if you have many users — see Google's docs on OAuth verification).
7. Review the summary and click **Back to Dashboard**.

### 4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **+ Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.
3. Set **Application type** to **Desktop app**.
4. Give it a name (e.g. `PrivacyFence Desktop`) and click **Create**.
5. In the confirmation dialog, click **Download JSON**. This is your `client_secret.json` — keep it private, treat it like a password.

   > **Deploying [`org` mode](org-mode-setup-guide.md) instead of (or in addition to) local desktop
   > installs?** Org mode's server-side redirect flow needs a **Web application** client, not a
   > Desktop app one, with explicit HTTPS redirect URIs registered — a different client id/secret
   > from the Desktop app client above (the two can coexist; local desktop installs and the org-mode
   > server just use different credentials for the same Google project). See
   > [`org-mode-setup-guide.md` §4.2](org-mode-setup-guide.md#42-the-google-connector-client-optional)
   > for the exact steps.

### 5. Add it to the organization config bundle

From the PrivacyFence repo (or anywhere with Python 3 installed — the script has no dependencies):

```bash
python3 scripts/build_org_bundle.py \
  --org-name "Your Company" \
  --google-client-secret /path/to/client_secret.json \
  -o org_config.json
```

Run it again with `--merge` if you're adding Google to a bundle that already has other services configured. Distribute the resulting `org_config.json` to your users (email, a shared drive, MDM — whatever your organization already uses to distribute internal tools).

---

## Room directory sync (optional, separate Google Cloud project)

Skip this whole section if your organization doesn't do Workspace room/resource booking —
every other Calendar tool works fine without it.

`calendar_list_rooms` doesn't call Google live. It reads a static room directory (name, email,
building, floor, capacity) that IT syncs into `org_config.json` ahead of time with
`scripts/sync_room_directory.py`. That script needs `admin.directory.resource.calendar.readonly`,
a Workspace-admin-level scope — and it deliberately runs against **a second Google Cloud
project**, separate from the one above, so the OAuth client every employee authorizes for
Gmail/Drive/Calendar/Contacts/Tasks never carries that scope. A leaked or over-shared per-user
token then simply can't read your Workspace directory, no matter what.

1. Create a **second** project the same way as step 1 above (e.g. `privacyfence-room-sync`).
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable **Admin SDK API** only.
3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** → same as step 3 above, but there's no need to add
   test users beyond whoever on your IT team will actually run the sync.
4. **APIs & Services → Credentials** → **+ Create Credentials → OAuth client ID** → **Desktop app**
   → **Download JSON**. This is a *second*, separate `client_secret.json` — keep it at least as
   private as the first one, and never add it to `org_config.json` or hand it to end users.
5. Run the sync, signed in with an account that holds the Workspace **Directory Reader** role (or
   super admin). Like `build_org_bundle.py`, this script doesn't need a full PrivacyFence install
   — copy it out of the repo if you like — just the same three Google client libraries PrivacyFence
   itself depends on:
   ```bash
   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
   python3 scripts/sync_room_directory.py \
     --admin-client-secret /path/to/room_sync_client_secret.json \
     --org-config org_config.json
   ```
   This merges a `rooms` snapshot into the existing bundle without touching its other sections.
   Re-run it whenever your organization's rooms change; `--token-file` (default
   `.room_sync_token.json`) caches the sync's own token so you don't have to re-consent every time
   — keep that file private too, for the same reason as the client secret.

   > **If `org_config.json` is already signed** (you built it with `build_org_bundle.py
   > --sign-key`, e.g. for [org mode](org-mode-setup-guide.md)), you MUST also pass `--sign-key
   > <path to that same signing key>` here. Merging the room directory in changes the bundle, which
   > invalidates its existing signature — `sync_room_directory.py` refuses to write anything at all
   > (leaving the file untouched) if you omit `--sign-key` on an already-signed bundle, precisely so
   > you don't accidentally distribute a bundle that every install with your key already pinned (or
   > any org-mode install, which requires signing) will then refuse to start on. An unsigned bundle
   > is unaffected — `--sign-key` stays optional there. Needs the `cryptography` package (`pip
   > install cryptography`) in addition to the three above, same as `build_org_bundle.py
   > --sign-key`.
6. Redistribute the updated `org_config.json` exactly as in step 5 above. The `rooms` data itself
   is plain metadata, not a credential, so it's fine for every user's install to have it.

## For users

**Local desktop install:**

1. Get `org_config.json` from your IT team.
2. In PrivacyFence Settings: **Organization Config…**, and select the file.
3. For each Google connector you want (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Apps Script): **Connectors → \<service\> → Authenticate…**. Your browser opens to Google's sign-in page — sign in and click **Allow**.
4. Quit and reopen PrivacyFence to activate the connector.

**[`org` mode](org-mode-setup-guide.md) deployment** (a server your IT team runs, not a desktop
install — ask them which applies to you; Apps Script isn't offered here, it stays local-mode-only,
see [`org-mode-setup-guide.md` §4.2](org-mode-setup-guide.md#42-the-google-connector-client-optional)):

1. Visit `https://your-server-hostname/login` and sign in with whatever identity provider your
   organization's server uses for sign-in (org mode's IdP is a separate, independent choice from
   which connectors it wires up — see [`org-mode-setup-guide.md`
   §4.1](org-mode-setup-guide.md#41-the-oidc-sign-in-client-required) — it's commonly Google too, but
   doesn't have to be). Either way, there's no separate "install a config file" step like local mode's.
2. On the `/connect` page, click **Connect** next to each Google connector you want (Gmail, Drive,
   Calendar, Contacts, Tasks). Each redirects to Google, asks for consent to that connector's specific
   scopes, and lands you back on `/connect` showing it connected.
3. Nothing to quit/reopen, since there's no local app. See [`org-mode-setup-guide.md`
   §8](org-mode-setup-guide.md#8-first-sign-in-and-connecting-a-service).

## Troubleshooting

**"Access blocked: PrivacyFence has not completed the Google verification process"** (IT admin)
The app is in Testing mode. Make sure the Google account signing in is listed as a test user (step 3.6 above), or submit the app for Google's verification if you have many users.

**"This app isn't verified"**
Click **Advanced → Go to PrivacyFence (unsafe)** to proceed. This warning appears for any unverified OAuth app and is expected until the org's app is verified by Google.

**"redirect_uri_mismatch"** (IT admin)
For a local desktop install, make sure you created credentials of type **Desktop app**, not Web
application — Desktop app clients accept any loopback redirect port, which is what PrivacyFence's
OAuth flow uses. For an [`org` mode](org-mode-setup-guide.md) deployment it's the other way around:
the connector client must be a **Web application** client with the exact
`https://your-server-hostname/oauth/callback/<service>` redirect URIs registered — see
[`org-mode-setup-guide.md` §4.2](org-mode-setup-guide.md#42-the-google-connector-client-optional).
These are two different, unrelated OAuth clients even against the same Google Cloud project — check
you're editing the one this install actually uses.

**Scopes not granted / 403 errors** (user)
Click **Reconnect…** next to the connector in PrivacyFence Settings to re-run the OAuth flow. From source, you can also run `privacyfence-app --gmail-oauth` (or `--drive-oauth` / `--contacts-oauth` / `--calendar-oauth` / `--tasks-oauth` / `--apps-script-oauth`).

**`calendar_list_rooms` comes back empty** (user)
This just means IT hasn't run `scripts/sync_room_directory.py` yet, or hasn't redistributed the
result — it's not an error. Ask IT to run the sync (see "Room directory sync" above) and send you
the refreshed `org_config.json`.

**`sync_room_directory.py` fails with "Room directory listing requires Google Workspace admin access"** (IT admin)
The Google account you signed in with when running the script isn't a Workspace admin and doesn't
hold the **Directory Reader** role. Re-run the script signed in as an account that does — this is
enforced by Google, not by PrivacyFence.
