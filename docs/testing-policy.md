# Testing Policy

What runs where, and when. This repo has three tiers of testing, plus one narrow scheduled
exception (§0) that only ever runs on infrastructure this project owns. See
[`coding-and-testing-guidelines.md`](coding-and-testing-guidelines.md) for how to *write* tests;
this document is about which ones run automatically versus which ones a human has to run. The
tiers below (§0–§3) are organized by *trust boundary* (what infrastructure/credentials a check
needs); the taxonomy immediately below organizes the same checks by *what they prove* — the two
are complementary, not competing, framings of the same suite.

## Core testing principle

**Do not test the full Cartesian product** (`OS × connector × operation × gate × browser × package
type`). Test each dimension independently, and cross a boundary only for a small number of
genuinely high-value end-to-end tests. Every tier and layer below is an application of this rule;
it is the reason the suite stays affordable while covering three operating systems, eleven
connectors, two deployment modes, and three package formats.

| Dimension | Proven by |
|---|---|
| Provider correctness | Live connector CI — §0's `connector-live-check.yml` |
| Gate/policy correctness | Synthetic deterministic integration tests — `tests/unit/test_gate.py`, `tests/integration/` |
| OS/runtime portability | Cross-platform core CI — `platform-windows`/`platform-macos`, `tests/platform/`, `tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py` |
| Browser behavior | Playwright — `tests/integration/test_browser_smoke.py` |
| Installer/package correctness | Native artifact CI — the `*_packaged_*`/`*_lifecycle`/`*_pkg_smoke` modules in `build.yml`, plus the three graphical-session workflows (macOS's own now also covering `test_macos_pkg_install.py`) |
| Org-mode deployment shape | Synthetic OIDC system CI — `tests/integration/test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py` |
| Real UX / subjective compatibility | Small manual checks — §3, [`release-testing.md`](release-testing.md) |

This principle, and the taxonomy below, came from the now-removed `automated-test-strategy-plan.md`,
which built out every row above and was retired once all of its phases had landed. This
document is where both live now.

## Test taxonomy: the seven layers

The finer-grained taxonomy exists because "CI vs. manual" alone doesn't say what a check actually
catches: a
`tests/unit/` module and `tests/integration/test_mcp_daemon_contract.py` are both "automated, every
PR" per §1 below, but they prove different things and fail for different reasons. Every check in
this repo, present or planned, is exactly one of:

| # | Layer | What it proves | Where it runs today | Pytest marker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unit | Python logic in isolation, fully offline | §1 below — `tests/unit/`, every PR | `unit` |
| 2 | Integration | Real internal stack (real sockets, servers, the real daemon process), no external network | §1 below — `tests/integration/`, every PR | `integration` |
| 3 | Cross-platform system | OS path/process/locking/daemon behavior, identical on Linux/Windows/macOS | Done. `test_mcp_daemon_contract.py` (§1 below) already proves the daemon→MCP→approval→audit *transport* contract on `ubuntu-latest`; `tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py` is the canonical scenario this layer actually names — a real `daemon_main.main()` subprocess (not an in-process call) driven through startup/discovery, the real `/approvals`/`/settings` web surfaces via a real bootstrap exchange, an MCP-client tool call resolved both Allow and Deny through the real HTTP decide route, the audit log read back from disk, and a graceful shutdown via the real "Quit PrivacyFence" action — collected by every job that runs the full suite (`test`, `platform-windows`, `platform-macos`), so it's proven identical on all three OSes with no extra CI wiring. `platform-windows` (renamed from `test-windows` by Phase 2.1) and `platform-macos` (Phase 2.2) both run the full core suite on every PR, deliberately, not narrowed to a targeted subset — Phase 2.4's own grounding pass found the full-suite run itself is what catches real cross-platform bugs (2.1's first run found four that a subset defined ahead of time would have missed), so the decision was to keep it rather than narrow it. `tests/platform/` (Phase 2.3) adds targeted coverage on top of that full run for OS path/process/locking/daemon-discovery behavior the full suite didn't otherwise reach (atomic-write concurrency, cross-process single-instance locking, the browser-launch default path, and a real spawned-daemon-process lifecycle) — deliberately not duplicated by Phase 3's own module, which adds only what neither `test_mcp_daemon_contract.py` nor `tests/platform/` covers: the full contract, end to end, as a real process, identically on all three OSes. Org mode's own equivalent canonical system-layer scenario is a separate module, `tests/integration/test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py` (TST-16) — same real-subprocess shape, but against a signed `org_config.json` and a mocked IdP instead of local mode's bootstrap secret: strict fail-closed startup, reverse-proxy Host handling, per-principal session/MCP-identity/authz-policy resolution, an approval exercised and audited under the *correct* principal, and persisted state (a confirmed rule, its audit trail) surviving a clean restart. Runs on `ubuntu-latest` only (no Windows/macOS org-mode job exists), in its own `org-mode-smoke` CI job, promoted the same way `platform-windows` was (Phase 8 item 2) from build.yml's release-tag-only `build-deb` job (which still runs it too, unchanged). | `system` (registered, applied to `tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py`, Phase 3, and to `test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py`, Phase 10 — see below) and `platform` (registered, applied to every module under `tests/platform/`) |
| 4 | Browser system | JS/CSP/rendering in a real browser | Done. `tests/integration/test_browser_smoke.py` (§1 below) drives real Chromium via Playwright on every PR — login, approval decisions (including "Always allow," live SSE refresh with multiple pending cards, and double-decision idempotency, Phase 4.1), PDF preview, CSP, org-mode WebAuthn UI, PII banner/confirmation-dialog behavior, responsive layout at three named viewports, and structural light/dark assertions. §2.2's `qa_web_smoke.py` still covers what a pytest-collected browser test structurally can't — subjective visual judgment (contrast, "does this look right" in light vs. dark, at a phone width) — and still only runs by hand; that's the genuinely layer-7 sliver Phase 4 deliberately left manual, not a residual automation gap. | `browser` (registered; not yet applied — `test_browser_smoke.py` predates this marker work, see the note below) |
| 5 | Live connector | Provider API drift | §0 below — `connector-live-check.yml`, self-hosted runner, scheduled. Done. | `live` (registered; nothing in the pytest suite carries it today, since this tier is a standalone script invocation, `qa_fixture_recorder.py --check`/`--record`, not a pytest-collected test — see §0/§2.1) |
| 6 | Packaged-artifact | Installer/package correctness | Done. `test_macos_packaged_smoke.py` (Phase 6.1, done) runs in `build.yml`'s tag-triggered release path — a real DMG mount, app bundle unpacked from the `.pkg` the image carries, daemon→MCP→approval round trip, code-signature/notarization chain (`codesign --verify`, `spctl --assess`), and a state-outside-package check (deleting the installed `.app` never touches `$HOME/.privacyfence`); `test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py` (Phase 6.3, done) runs the Linux `.deb` install/validate/remove/purge and upgrade-in-place lifecycles the same way, in `build.yml`'s `build-deb` job; `test_windows_packaged_smoke.py` (Phase 6.2, done) runs a real silent install/autostart-task-registration/uninstall lifecycle against the Windows installer the same way, in `build.yml`'s `build-windows` job. Upgrade/state-preservation testing across all three platforms is also done (item 20) — macOS/Windows each got their own version-N→N+1 upgrade test, Linux's own having already landed inside Phase 6.3. `publish-pypi.yml` additionally gates every one of its own publish steps (TestPyPI/PyPI/R2) on `build.yml`'s run for the same commit actually succeeding (Phase 6.4) — a broken packaged artifact on any platform now blocks the whole tag's release, not just its own platform's upload. Linux's own graphical-session/autostart verification is also done — `test_linux_graphical_session_autostart.py` brings up a real `systemd --user` login-equivalent session and starts `xdg-desktop-autostart.target` (standing in for the missing physical login), then confirms the real `systemd-xdg-autostart-generator`-produced unit actually launches the packaged daemon and that "Quit PrivacyFence" stops the real unit; a second test in the same module proves the real (unmocked) OAuth loopback browser-opening flow under a genuine Xvfb `$DISPLAY`. Deliberately scheduled in its own `linux-graphical-session.yml` workflow (packaging-related `main` pushes, weekly, on demand), not per-PR or wired into `build.yml`'s release pipeline — the most expensive tier here, so its runtime cost is kept off the release's critical path rather than run inline with it. `build.yml`'s `finalize-release` job still checks, on every tag, whether the latest run of each of the three graphical-session workflows reachable from the tagged commit actually succeeded (`scripts/check_graphical_session_coverage.py`, privacyfence/privacyfence#374) — never by waiting for a fresh run, only by asking whether a reachable one already passed, so this stays off the critical path either way; a gap only ever warns on a pre-release tag, but fails the job outright on a stable one, so a stable release can no longer ship silently on top of missing, stale, or red autostart coverage. Windows' equivalent is built the same way — `test_windows_graphical_session_autostart.py` installs silently, asserts the autostart task definition **Task Scheduler itself stored** (`schtasks /query /xml`, not this repo's template) element by element, has Task Scheduler itself start the packaged `privacyfence-app.exe` alias — into the real signed-in account's own profile, with no injected environment, confirmed running as that account via `Win32_Process`'s `GetOwner`, not assumed, runs the same daemon/MCP/approval/audit round trip, confirms "Quit PrivacyFence" ends the real process; a second test kills the daemon outright and pins what Task Scheduler then does, which is nothing — Phase 13 item 4's `<RestartOnFailure>` does not cover an action that ran and then died, measured from the service's own operational log — scheduled the same way, in its own `windows-graphical-session.yml` workflow. Was red on every run for a series of independent, real bugs, the first two in `schtasks /create`'s plain CLI flags (invalid flags for an `ONLOGON` schedule; then a trigger scoped to the installing account instead of any interactive logon), both superseded once the mechanism moved to a real Task Scheduler XML task definition, which itself then had two further real bugs of its own (an XML-prolog encoding declaration `schtasks` rejected outright; a `Principal`/`Actions` id/Context binding missing from the schema), and finally for a defect in the test rather than the installer: its old stand-in for signing in, `Start-Process -Credential`, doesn't create the Terminal Services session logon a `LogonTrigger` subscribes to, so the trigger was never evaluated at all. That substitution is gone; the trigger's own firing is a Windows human check in `release-testing.md` now (no hosted runner can produce a session logon), and everything else above is asserted for real. The cheap half of the same coverage also runs per-PR on any OS — `tests/unit/test_windows_autostart_task_template.py` holds the shipped template to the same contract (`tests/windows_task_contract.py`) this module holds the registered definition to. macOS's own graphical-session/autostart verification is also done now (B19, privacyfence/privacyfence#374, closing the gap the other two platforms already had) — `test_macos_graphical_session_autostart.py` drives `scripts/macos_privilege_separation.sh enable` directly via passwordless `sudo` (the only unattended path in CI: `maybe_auto_enable_macos()`'s own real path pops a GUI admin-password dialog nothing in CI can answer) and confirms both halves of ADR 0002's inversion for real — the daemon actually running as a `system/` LaunchDaemon under the dedicated `_privacyfence` account, and the companion actually running as a LaunchAgent bootstrapped into the CI account's own already-logged-in `gui/<uid>` Aqua session, each with its own control-channel socket present under the separated `handoff/` directory, and the daemon's own `mcp_token` present under `authority/` (ADR 0008 D3) — not just "launchd thinks it's active". Deliberately narrower than the Linux/Windows modules (no second real login to prove the companion's own browser/tray behavior, no MCP round trip — that's already covered by `test_macos_packaged_smoke.py` against a directly-exec'd binary): a real GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` runner only ever gives this one already-logged-in session to work with. Scheduled the same way, in its own `macos-graphical-session.yml` workflow. See `platform-support.md`'s "Known open items" for the full history and current status — check that workflow's own run history rather than trusting this note alone. `scripts/build_pkg.sh`'s installer package (the installer the DMG carries, which provisions privilege separation from its own `postinstall` script at install time rather than leaving it to the daemon's runtime admin-password prompt) gets the same two-tier split as the DMG itself: `test_macos_pkg_smoke.py` is the fast, no-install structural check (`pkgutil --expand-full`, postinstall/payload presence, signature) that runs inline in `build.yml`'s release-critical `build` job right after `test_macos_packaged_smoke.py`; `test_macos_pkg_install.py` is the heavy half — a real `sudo installer -pkg ... -target /` with no separate `enable` call, proving the postinstall script alone wires up both the LaunchDaemon and the companion LaunchAgent the same way `test_macos_graphical_session_autostart.py` proves the manual-script path — and lives in the same `macos-graphical-session.yml` workflow for the same off-the-critical-path reason. | `packaged` (registered; applied to all three packaged-artifact modules — `test_macos_packaged_smoke.py` picked it up as part of Phase 6.1 — and to `test_linux_graphical_session_autostart.py`/`test_windows_graphical_session_autostart.py`/`test_macos_graphical_session_autostart.py`/`test_macos_pkg_smoke.py`/`test_macos_pkg_install.py`) |
| 7 | Manual exploratory/UX | Subjective judgment, first-time auth/consent flows | §3 below, [`connector-qa-testing.md`](connector-qa-testing.md), [`release-testing.md`](release-testing.md) | — (never automated, by definition — see the governing rule below) |

**What a green `test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py` (TST-16) does and does not prove:** this module
is layer 3's org-mode deployment-shape scenario — strict fail-closed startup, reverse-proxy Host
handling, per-principal sessions, MCP OAuth discovery, an approval exercised and audited under the
correct principal, and persisted state surviving a restart, all against a real `daemon_main.main()`
subprocess. It is not, and was never meant to be, proof that a signed-in principal's own connector
tools or auto-accept rules are actually correct — that is layer 1/2's job (the "Gate/policy
correctness" row above: `tests/unit/test_gate.py`, `tests/integration/`), and this module's own
synthetic `org_config.json` is deliberately zero-connector (no real Google/Slack/... credential to
authenticate with), so connector-tool content and auto-accept-rule application are structurally
invisible to it regardless of whether either is broken. Both were broken at once, on the same real
install, and both shipped past a fully green run of this module before being found by hand and
fixed (`8322c111`: `/mcp`'s tool list was built outside the signed-in principal's scope, so it
advertised `LOCAL_PRINCIPAL`'s — empty — connectors on every org server; `cfe3716c`: a principal's
`settings.yaml` auto-accept rules were loaded but never seeded into that principal's
`AutoAcceptEvaluator`, so every gated call went to a human regardless of what was configured). Both
are proven, deterministically, at the layer that actually can: `tests/unit/web/test_routes_mcp.py::
TestListTools` for the tool-list scoping, `tests/unit/test_daemon_main.py::
TestLoadPrincipalSettings` for the evaluator seeding — see `test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py`'s own
module docstring for why proving either one *here* would need a connector client this codebase
doesn't have (one whose external API call can be pointed at a local mock, the way `mock_idp.py`
stands in for a real IdP) rather than a config change. Read a green TST-16 run as "org mode deploys
and authenticates correctly," never as "org mode works" on its own.

**Governing rule for what stays manual:** a test stays manual only when automated observation
cannot reliably determine pass/fail. In this project that bar is met by exactly two recurring
cases — visual/subjective judgment (contrast, spacing, "does this look right" in light vs. dark
mode) and a first-time third-party consent/OAuth screen (rendered by the provider, outside this
codebase's control, and different account-to-account) — and nothing else should be left manual on
that basis. Anything else currently manual (§2 below) is there because it needs a real credential
or a real browser binary CI doesn't provision, not because it can't be judged automatically — a
cost-of-infrastructure reason, and the now-removed `automated-test-strategy-plan.md` existed to
remove those one at a time, which it did.

**What deliberately remains manual**, in full — nothing else should be added to this list without
meeting the bar above:

- visual and subjective judgment (contrast, spacing, light vs. dark at a phone width);
- first-time OAuth/consent-screen onboarding, rendered by the provider and different
  account-to-account;
- one real external MCP-client compatibility smoke;
- OS-native UX presentation (SmartScreen, Gatekeeper, UAC), when the corresponding platform
  integration changes;
- the Windows `LogonTrigger`'s own firing — no hosted runner can produce a Terminal Services
  session logon (see [`release-testing.md`](release-testing.md)'s Windows human checks);
- human review of detected-but-not-yet-judged provider drift (§0, §2.1).

None of these get multiplied across every OS × connector combination.

**Pytest markers**: seven markers are now registered in `pyproject.toml`'s
`[tool.pytest.ini_options]` — the original six plus `platform`,
added as its own marker rather than reusing `system`
per Phase 0's own status note: `system` was reserved for, and is now applied to,
`tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py` (Phase 3) — the canonical daemon/MCP/approval/audit
scenario, a different concept from `tests/platform/`'s OS-level path/process/locking/daemon-
discovery tests. `test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py` (Phase 8's org-mode equivalent of that same
canonical scenario) picked up `system` too, by Phase 10 — not when it first landed, since at the
time nothing yet selected on the marker; Phase 10's own CI-diagnostics capture
(`tests/diagnostics.py`) is what now does, for exactly the `packaged`/`system`-marked tests it
targets. Consistent with Phase 0's own scope note, markers are *not* retroactively applied
across every existing test — that would be churn with no payoff until something actually needs to
select on the marker (e.g. `pytest -m "not live"`). The five modules that landed as part of closing
out the remediation plan's Phase 3.12 (`test_qa_fixture_recorder.py`'s
`TestFixturePresence`, `test_deferred_approval_round_trip.py`, `test_routes_security.py`'s
`TestCrossPrincipalIsolation`, `test_parser_properties.py`, `test_systemic_gate_invariants.py`)
landed before this marker work existed and were the first backfill; every module under
`tests/platform/` carries `platform` from the day it was added, per the rule below; everything else
keeps whatever marker (none, today) it already had. New test modules should carry the marker that
matches their layer from the day they're added.

## Test ownership: failure type → layer

| Failure type | Owning layer |
|---|---|
| Wrong business logic, parsing bug, or malformed output from a pure function | 1. Unit |
| Regression in real internal wiring — daemon ↔ web routes ↔ gate ↔ audit — with no external network involved | 2. Integration |
| OS-specific bug: works on Linux, breaks on Windows/macOS (path separators, locking, process spawning, daemon discovery) | 3. Cross-platform system |
| Bug only a real browser exposes: script-order/DOM-timing, a CSP directive that silently blocks something, real rendering at a given viewport or color scheme | 4. Browser system |
| Provider API drift: a field renamed, an endpoint removed, a response shape changed | 5. Live connector |
| Installer/package bug: files not registered at the expected path, autostart missing, uninstall/purge leaves stray files, upgrade loses user state | 6. Packaged-artifact |
| Subjective visual defect (contrast, spacing, layout "looking right") | 7. Manual exploratory/UX |
| First-time third-party consent/OAuth screen behaving unexpectedly | 7. Manual exploratory/UX |

Every layer but the last is, by the governing rule above, a candidate to *stay* automated — a
failure type that currently lands in layer 7 only belongs there if it's one of the two named
exceptions; otherwise it's a sign the corresponding automation genuinely hasn't landed yet, not
that the failure type is inherently manual.

### Checked against `release-testing.md`

Every item that used to require manual release QA maps to exactly one layer above, and every layer
but 7 is now fully automated (see the taxonomy table above). What's left genuinely manual today is
exactly layer 7's two named exceptions (visual/
subjective judgment, first-time third-party consent) plus a small set of infrastructure-cost items
(a real third-party MCP client, OS-native trust-prompt presentation) — all covered by
[`release-testing.md`](release-testing.md), the evergreen standing reference for what stays manual
and why. `connector-qa-testing.md` covers the narrower, non-routine case: a new connector, a
material connector/gate change, or an unexplained regression — not a routine release.

## 0. Runner-local live tier (scheduled, not per-PR)

*Layer 5 (live connector) in the taxonomy above.*

`.github/workflows/connector-live-check.yml` runs `qa_fixture_recorder.py --check` (and, on
drift, `--record`), then `qa_fixture_recorder.py --lifecycle` (§2.1's bounded lifecycle mode --
create/read/update/delete a fresh QA object per write-capable connector), against the four
dedicated test accounts (Google, Slack, Atlassian, Salesforce) on a weekly schedule (plus
`workflow_dispatch`) — never on `pull_request`, and never on a GitHub-hosted runner. Unlike
`--check`'s drift (data, not a failure), a `--lifecycle` failure fails the job outright: a failed
write/read/update is a real provider-contract regression, and a cleanup call that ran but didn't
actually remove what it created would otherwise silently accumulate objects in the QA accounts
forever. It targets a self-hosted runner this project provisions and controls
(label `privacyfence-test`), provisioned per
[`connector-live-check-setup.md`](connector-live-check-setup.md) Phase B. The four OAuth
token files and `org/org_config.json` live only as local files on that runner — they are never
added as GitHub Actions secrets, and are never transmitted to GitHub at all. See
[`connector-live-check-setup.md`](connector-live-check-setup.md) for the full account/runner setup
and the reasoning behind isolating this tier from every GitHub-hosted job.

On drift, the job re-records the affected fixtures and opens an ordinary PR
(`chore/connector-live-fixture-drift`) with the redacted diff; a maintainer reviews it exactly as
they would review a manually-run `--record` per §2.1 below. That PR then runs through §1's normal
GitHub-hosted `tests.yml` merge gate like any other PR — the live-credential job and the
credential-free merge gate never share a runner or a trigger.

## 1. Automated suite — every PR, in CI

*Layers 1 (unit) and 2 (integration) in the taxonomy above, plus most of what layer 4 (browser
system) already has — see `test_browser_smoke.py` below.*

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on every push to `main` and every pull request:

```bash
npm test              # mcpb/shim/, Node's built-in test runner
npm run typecheck     # mcpb/shim/, tsc --noEmit
pytest -v --cov=src/privacyfence --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json:coverage.json
python scripts/check_coverage_floor.py coverage.json
```

on an `ubuntu-latest` runner. A 100% pass rate is required to merge, for both suites. Coverage
itself is a ratchet, not a specific percentage a PR must hit: `scripts/check_coverage_floor.py` fails the build
if overall branch+line coverage, or the coverage of any module on its security-critical list (the
URL-scheme allowlist, identity-matching, audit-export, org-config/bundle-trust, session/token-
lifetime, privacy-filter, secure-write, OIDC-discovery-trust, and MCP-error-taxonomy code paths —
see that script's `MODULE_FLOORS` for the exact list), drops below where it was recorded. A PR that
raises coverage on one of those modules should bump its floor in the same PR; a PR that needs to
*lower* one is a real regression, not a config edit. `pytest`'s own `--cov-report=json`/`html`
output is uploaded as a `coverage-report` CI artifact on every run (pass or fail) so a regression
can be inspected without re-running locally.

`tests.yml` runs six jobs on every PR: this `test` job; `platform-windows`/`platform-macos` (the
full core suite again on real Windows/macOS runners — see §3's system-layer row above for what
these add); `test-python-compat` (the same core suite, Node-free, against Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.14 —
reported as three separate checks, one per Python version, since each matrix leg is its own GitHub
check; 3.14 is there because it is the default `python3` on current Ubuntu releases, so it is what
a plain `pip install privacyfence` resolves against on a fresh box); `org-mode-smoke` (`test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py`, see §3's row above); and
`static-analysis`'s blocking `ruff check .`, `bandit` and `scripts/mypy_strict_modules.py` steps
(its whole-tree `mypy` step is still `continue-on-error` and stays informational; the modules
promoted by `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` are blocking — see `coding-and-testing-guidelines.md`). `scripts/update_branch_protection.py`'s
`REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECKS` is the reviewable record of exactly which of those checks are *meant* to
be required — update it in the same PR whenever
a job here is added, renamed, or removed.

The live setting is a **repository ruleset** (Settings → Rules → Rulesets, the `main` ruleset), not
a classic branch-protection rule — reading the classic `/branches/main/protection` endpoint instead
returns `enforcement_level: "off"` with empty `contexts` purely because no classic rule exists,
which is a false negative that has already been reported as a finding once. The ruleset currently
requires all of the checks above, with "require branches to be up to date" on and an empty bypass
list, so it applies to admins too.

That is still repo configuration this repo doesn't track as a file and no CI job enforces:
`REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECKS` is the *intended* set, and applying it remains a deliberate, unautomated
step a repo admin takes by running `scripts/update_branch_protection.py apply` against GitHub
directly — see that script's own docstring for why this is intentionally not wired into CI. Run its
`show` to compare the intent here against what is live.

Through P9 this ran on `macos-latest` instead, and a second, non-blocking `test-linux` job carried
the platform-independent subset (everything under `web/`, `web_approval_ui.py`, `card_builder.py`,
and `approval_icons.py`) on `ubuntu-latest`, `--ignore`-ing the handful of test modules that imported
an AppKit-tainted module (`approval_popup.py`/`approval_window.py`/`dialog_window.py`/`menu_bar.py`)
directly at module scope. P10 deleted all
of that — the native menu bar/approval dialogs/settings window — so nothing in this repo depends on
real AppKit/PyObjC behavior any more, the whole suite is platform-independent, and the two-job split
collapsed back into one.

This tier is fully self-contained: no network calls to Gmail/Slack/Jira/etc., no credentials, no
manual steps. It includes:

- Every module under `tests/unit/`, one test module per `src/privacyfence/` module — with one
  deliberate exception: `connector_host.py`'s `ConnectorHost` (the live `{name: Connector}` map) has
  no `test_connector_host.py` of its own; its behavior is exercised through its three consumers'
  own test modules instead (`test_settings_controller.py`, `test_daemon_main.py`,
  `tests/unit/web/test_routes_settings.py`, `tests/unit/web/test_server.py`), since it's a thin
  enough holder that testing it in isolation would just re-mock what those already cover for real.
- Each connector's `TestLiveFixtureParsing` class (in `tests/unit/test_<connector>_client.py`),
  which replays a **previously recorded** fixture from `tests/fixtures/live/<connector>/` through
  the real `_parse_*` method — still fully offline, since it's reading a committed JSON file, not
  making a live API call. See [§2.1](#21-qa_fixture_recorderpy---check----record) below for how those
  fixtures get recorded in the first place. A connector with no recorded fixture yet has its
  `TestLiveFixtureParsing` tests skip (not fail) with a message pointing at the recorder.
- `tests/unit/test_qa_fixture_recorder.py` — unit tests for the recorder script itself
  (`scripts/qa_fixture_recorder.py`), exercised against mocked/offline API responses. This is
  different from actually running the recorder: these tests prove the recorder's own logic
  (redaction, capture mechanisms, the tag guardrail) is correct without touching any real account.
- `tests/unit/test_approval_window_html.py`, `tests/unit/test_dialog_window_html.py` — construction-
  only coverage for the pure HTML builders behind every card/confirmation dialog (content, buttons,
  PII tint/banner, summary rows, details text). Through P9 these were rendered inside a real native
  AppKit view tree too (`test_approval_window.py`/`test_dialog_window.py`, covering the modal-loop
  host around the same HTML); P10 deleted that host, so this construction-only tier is now the whole
  of it.
- `tests/unit/test_web_approval_ui.py`, `tests/unit/test_card_builder.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_approval_icons.py`, `tests/unit/web/` — the web approval surface's own coverage,
  added at P1: `WebApprovalUI`'s blocking contract (the sole `ApprovalUI` implementation since P10 —
  see `approval_ui.py`'s ABC), the pure gate-args-to-card-HTML translation, shared icon-asset loading,
  and the approval routes themselves against an in-process ASGI test client (auth, CSRF, Host
  allowlist, security headers, idempotent decisions — no real socket).
- `tests/unit/web/test_mcp_dispatch.py`, `tests/unit/web/test_routes_mcp.py` — the `/mcp` endpoint's
  own coverage, added at P2: `McpDispatcher`'s dedupe/staleness/gating dispatch and meta-tools
  (`test_mcp_dispatch.py`) and the wire-protocol/auth layer on top of it (`test_routes_mcp.py`),
  driven with the real official `mcp` Python client over an in-process ASGI transport — no real
  socket, same posture as the approval routes above. `TestAudienceSeparation` in
  `tests/unit/web/test_server.py` is the one required to fail loudly if the MCP bearer-token and
  approval-surface session-cookie middleware are ever reordered.
- `tests/unit/web/test_mcp_tools.py` — added at phase 1.9 (TST-02):
  `mcp_tools.py`'s own `ToolSpec`-to-`Tool`/`CallToolResult` schema translation (untested by either
  file above, which exercise dispatch and wire framing, not this mapping layer), plus end-to-end
  coverage over the real `/mcp` transport for three narrow behaviors: an unattended session denying
  `privacyfence_propose_auto_accept_rule_change` before any confirmation popup can be shown (a real
  gap this phase found and fixed — see `McpDispatcher.propose_rule_change`'s own comment in
  `mcp_dispatch.py`), `privacyfence_begin_unattended_session` refusing when disabled by
  configuration, and `privacyfence_list_auto_accept_rules` always leaving an audit entry for its own
  disclosure.
- `mcpb/shim/test/*.test.ts` (`npm test`, run from `mcpb/shim/`) — the .mcpb shim's own suite:
  daemon discovery/launch (`daemon.test.ts`, against
  `mcp_url` file discovery) and the stdio<->Streamable HTTP message proxy (`proxy.test.ts`,
  `index.test.ts` — the latter against a real fake `/mcp` server built on the official SDK's own
  server classes, not a hand-mocked transport). The only Node suite left in this repo since P5
  retired the original bridge and its own `bridge/test/*.test.ts`.
- `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`, run from `mcpb/shim/`) — catches type errors across
  `mcpb/shim/src/*.ts` that `npm test`'s runtime coverage wouldn't necessarily hit (an unreachable
  branch, a type mismatch in an untested code path).
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_daemon_contract.py` — spawns a real `privacyfence.web.server.WebServer`
  bound to a real loopback socket and drives it with the official `mcp` Python client over a real
  TCP connection (not the in-process ASGI transport `test_routes_mcp.py` above uses), so a
  real-network-stack bug (uvicorn startup, real TCP binding, real HTTP framing) can't slip through
  either. Needs no Node — since P5 there is no longer a second, independently-maintained protocol
  implementation to cross-check against (both client and server here are the official `mcp` SDK).
  Uses the official `mcp` Python client, a runtime dependency since P2 (`pyproject.toml`'s
  `[project.dependencies]`) rather than a
  test-only one.
- `tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py` (layer 3, cross-platform system) — the one module in
  this tier that spawns the real
  `python -m privacyfence.daemon_main` entry point as a genuinely separate OS process (every module
  above drives daemon/server code as a plain in-process call), and runs it through the full
  contract: `mcp_url`/lock-file discovery, `/approvals`/`/settings` reached via a real one-time
  bootstrap exchange (minted through the #428 Phase 2 control channel, never a link scraped out of
  the log — `safe_errors.SecretRedactingFormatter` deliberately redacts those), a gated MCP tool
  call resolved both Allow
  and Deny through the real HTTP decide route, the audit log read back from disk to confirm both
  decisions, and a graceful shutdown via the real "Quit PrivacyFence" action. Collected by every job
  that runs the full suite (`test`, `platform-windows`, `platform-macos`), so this one module proves
  the scenario identical on Linux, Windows, and macOS with no extra CI wiring — the same
  `pyproject.toml` `testpaths = ["tests"]` mechanism `tests/platform/` (Phase 2.3) already relies on.
- `tests/integration/test_shim_mcp_contract.py` — spawns the real built `mcpb/shim/dist/shim.js`
  against that same real, socket-bound `WebServer` and drives *it* with the official `mcp` Python
  client over real MCP-over-stdio. A passthrough test, not a schema test — the shim carries no
  tool-schema knowledge, so "one `initialize` and one `tools/call` round-trip, with the bearer
  header attached and `mcp_url` honoured" is the whole of what there is to assert. Skips
  automatically if Node isn't on `PATH`; CI installs it, so this runs there.
- `tests/integration/test_browser_smoke.py` (TST-06) — drives the real web approval surface in a
  real headless Chromium via Playwright: bootstrap login, an Allow/Deny decision round trip, PDF
  preview actually rendering, a real no-inline-script CSP check, and the org-mode WebAuthn UI. The
  one place in this tier that exercises what only a real browser does — the CSP header actually
  enforced, cookie `SameSite` semantics on a real `fetch()`, the page's own JS event loop
  (`EventSource`, `navigator.credentials`) — rather than a scripted transport (`test_routes_
  approvals.py`) or a real socket driven by a non-browser client (`test_mcp_daemon_contract.py`
  above). This is layer 4 (browser system) in the taxonomy at the top of this document; it already
  runs here in tier 1 because Playwright/Chromium install cleanly on `ubuntu-latest` with no
  external credential, unlike the connector accounts §0/§2.1 need. This file's coverage was later
  extended (empty-list/multi-card/idempotency behavior, PII-specific
  banner assertions, responsive layout, light/dark structural assertions) — that extension did not
  need to create the layer, which was already here.

## 2. Local-only checks — run manually before opening/updating a relevant PR, never in CI

*§2.1 is a local-only slice of layer 5 (live connector), run by hand between §0's scheduled runs.
§2.2 is a local-only slice of layer 4 (browser system), covering the subjective/visual-judgment
sliver `test_browser_smoke.py`'s own structural checks in §1 can't reach (light/dark contrast,
phone-width "does this look right") — neither is layer 7 (manual exploratory/UX) in the
`qa_fixture_recorder.py`/deterministic-report sense: both are fully deterministic, just not yet safe
or fast enough to run on a GitHub-hosted PR runner.*

Two scripts exist specifically because some failure classes can't be caught by a fully-mocked,
fully-offline suite. Both are excluded from CI on purpose — one needs real, authenticated
third-party accounts; the other needs a real browser — and both print the same kind of small,
deterministic Markdown report meant to be pasted into the PR description so a reviewer doesn't have
to re-run anything or have access to the same accounts/hardware themselves.

Through P9 a third script, `qa_popup_smoke.py`, covered the one thing `test_approval_window.py`/
`test_dialog_window.py`'s construction-only tests couldn't reach: whether the real native modal loop
actually blocked and a real click actually reached it. P10 deleted the native popup itself along with that script — there is no modal loop left to smoke-
test. `qa_web_smoke.py` below is this tier's own (Chromium-driven, not AppKit-driven) equivalent for
the web approval surface that replaced it, and already existed before this phase; nothing new was
needed to fill the gap.

### 2.1 `qa_fixture_recorder.py --check` / `--record`

Every `tests/unit/test_<connector>_client.py` module mocks the connector's `*_client.py` (or the
third-party SDK object one layer inside it), which is correct for testing this codebase's own
parsing logic in isolation — but it has a structural blind spot: a hand-authored mock fixture can
drift out of sync with what the real provider API actually returns (a field renamed, an endpoint
removed, a response shape changed) while the mocked test suite stays green. `scripts/
qa_fixture_recorder.py` closes that gap by calling the real, targeted read methods against a real,
already-authenticated account.

**Never run on a GitHub-hosted runner, or on any `pull_request`-triggered workflow.** It reuses the
exact OAuth token files `privacyfence-app --<connector>-oauth` writes to the git-ignored
`credentials/` directory, and only ever targets one specific, `[QATEST]`-tagged seed artifact per
connector — set up once per environment via [`qa-environment-setup.md`](qa-environment-setup.md),
resolved through the non-secret, git-ignored manifest `tests/fixtures/qa_environment.yaml` (see
[`qa_environment.yaml.example`](../tests/fixtures/qa_environment.yaml.example) for the template). No
credential is ever provisioned to a GitHub-hosted runner or any other shared cloud service to make
this possible.

The instructions below are for running this by hand, from your own machine, between scheduled
runs — still valid and still the right thing to do for a PR that touches a `*_client.py` or
`connectors/**` file. §0 above describes the one place this also now runs automatically: a
project-owned self-hosted runner, on a schedule, per
[`connector-live-check-setup.md`](connector-live-check-setup.md).

Three modes:

- `--check [connector ...]` — calls each connector's read methods against its seed artifact,
  asserts non-empty/expected results, prints a report. Never writes a file. Safe to run any time.
  The printed report also includes a **fixture freshness** line per connector checked: `< 60 days`
  healthy, `60–90 days` warning, `> 90 days` refresh required — a quick signal for whether a
  connector's recorded fixture is due for a fresh `--record`, without doing the day-count
  arithmetic by hand.
- `--record [connector ...]` — the same calls, plus identity-field redaction (author email, account
  id, display name, ...) and structural de-identification (opaque resource ids, decorative URLs —
  neither of which any test actually depends on the specific value of), then writes the result to
  `tests/fixtures/live/<connector>/<method>.json`.
- `--lifecycle [connector ...]` — for each write-capable connector that supports it (`calendar`, `confluence`, `jira`,
  `tasks` — see the comment above `LIFECYCLE_CHECKS` in `qa_fixture_recorder.py` for why
  `contacts`/`gmail`/`drive`/`slack`/`salesforce`/`telegram` aren't included), creates a fresh,
  uniquely-tagged QA object, reads it back, updates it, reads it back again, then deletes it and
  confirms the deletion actually took, using the same run's redaction-free internal SDK access
  `RawCapture`/`RawCaptureExecute` already use — never a tool any MCP client can reach, since
  nothing in `connectors/**` ever registers a delete tool at all. Never writes a fixture file. Runs
  on the same weekly self-hosted-runner schedule as `--check`/`--record` (§0 above); safe to run by
  hand too, same caveats as `--check`/`--record`.

**When to run this**: only when a PR touches `src/privacyfence/*_client.py` or
`src/privacyfence/connectors/**` — not every PR. Scope it to the connector(s) touched, using the
project's own venv (a bare system `python3` won't have the third-party clients this imports):

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/qa_fixture_recorder.py --check confluence
```

- **Passes, live shape unchanged**: nothing else to do. `--check` never writes a file.
- **Fails, or the fix was specifically in response to a provider shape change**: run
  `--record <connector>`, inspect the diff under `tests/fixtures/live/<connector>/*.json` — it
  should be a small, meaningful shape change, with identity fields already redacted to placeholders
  (if anything in the diff looks like a real email, name, or account-specific id, the redaction
  logic needs a fix before committing, not after) — then commit the updated fixtures alongside the
  code fix, in the same PR.
- Paste the printed report (or the file from `--report-file <path>`) into the PR description under
  a `## Local QA check` heading.

### 2.2 `qa_web_smoke.py`

`tests/unit/web/`, `test_web_shell.py`, and `test_approval_list_html.py` cover the web surfaces'
(`/settings`, `/approvals`) HTML/JSON construction and route behavior — CSRF, the settings action
allowlist, argument validation — on every PR, entirely against Starlette's in-process `TestClient`.
That deliberately leaves one thing untested: a **real browser** actually parsing and running the JS
those routes emit. A script tag referencing a DOM element or another script's global defined *later*
in the document silently no-ops instead of raising in a real browser — this script's own "card
decide → return-to-list toast" scenario is a regression test for exactly that bug (approval_list_
html.py's toast/notification-prompt code read `#pf-shell-toast`, defined by web_shell.py *after* it
in document order, before that element existed — found by running this script during P4's own
development, not by any unit test). It also confirms the CSP (web/server.py's `_CSP`) actually
permits what a page needs — e.g. that `worker-src 'self'` really does let `resources/sw.js` register,
not just that the header string contains the right token.

**Never run in CI.** It needs `playwright` (`pip install playwright` — not a project dependency,
install it locally) and a Chromium binary, and drives a real embedded HTTP server + real browser
end to end, which is slower and flakier than the route-level suite that already runs on every PR.

**When to run this**: whenever `web_shell.py`, `approval_list_html.py`, the JS-emitting functions in
`web/routes_approvals.py`/`web/routes_settings.py`, `resources/sw.js`, or `web/server.py`'s CSP
changes. Not for a `settings_controller.py`/`settings_window_html.py` change with no web-shell/CSP
involvement — those are covered by `test_settings_window_html.py`'s construction-only assertions.

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install playwright
.venv/bin/python scripts/qa_web_smoke.py
```

If Playwright's own bundled Chromium isn't installed, pass `--chromium-path` at a Chromium/Chrome
binary already on disk instead of downloading one. Paste the printed report into the PR description
under a `## Web smoke check` heading, same convention as §2.1.

## 3. Full manual QA pass — before a release, not per-PR

*Layer 7 (manual exploratory/UX) in the taxonomy above — this is the one tier the governing rule
says should stay manual. A later cross-check found how much of what
this tier used to be the only proof for is actually deterministic gate behavior that belongs in
`test_gate.py` (layer 2) instead, and confirmed `test_gate.py` already covers nearly all of it —
this tier has shrunk accordingly, to the parts that genuinely need a human watching a real popup
render against real account data (or a live provider's own tool-to-gate-metadata mapping, which
`test_gate.py` deliberately doesn't duplicate per connector).*

[`connector-qa-testing.md`](connector-qa-testing.md) drives every tool through a live Claude
Cowork/Desktop session connected to the real `privacyfence` daemon, against real accounts, watching
what actually prompts. It is no longer the primary proof for gate-state correctness — that's
`test_gate.py`'s job now, confirmed exhaustive by Phase 5 — but it's still the only thing that
exercises the gate, the popup UI, and the audit log against a live provider end to end, and it stays
the route to catch a connector's tool wired to the wrong gate/metadata in the first place. Run it
before a release, or after any change to `gate.py`/`auto_accept.py`/`policy/resource_registry.py`/
the web approval UI broadly, not on every PR.

A routine release no longer runs §2.1/§2.2 across every connector on principle —
[release-testing.md](release-testing.md)'s own "before release" check just confirms §0's scheduled
fixture check is recent and green, and reserves this full manual pass for the same trigger as
above: a broad gate/auto-accept/approval-UI change since the last release, not the mere fact that a
release is happening.

| `connector-qa-testing.md`'s live Cowork pass | 7 | No | A new connector, a material connector/gate change, an unexplained regression, or a broad gate/auto-accept/approval-UI change — not routine releases (Phase 9) |

Layer 3 (cross-platform system) is now fully settled here (the two rows above) — `tests/platform/`
gives it a real, named subset of its own, and the canonical daemon/MCP/approval/audit scenario on
all three OSes (`tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py`)
has landed too. Layer 6 (packaged-artifact) is now also fully settled — see the taxonomy table
above: all three platforms' install/lifecycle/
upgrade tests are wired into `build.yml`, `publish-pypi.yml`'s own publish steps are gated on
`build.yml`'s run for the same commit succeeding (Phase 6.4), and all three platforms' own
graphical-session/autostart verification (Phase 7 items 1–2, plus macOS's own B19 fix-up) are
wired into their own scheduled `linux-graphical-session.yml`/`windows-graphical-session.yml`/
`macos-graphical-session.yml` workflows rather than `build.yml`,
since this tier's own runtime cost must not sit on the release's critical path.

None of the "No" rows require a credential or secret to ever be granted to a **GitHub-hosted**
runner or any `pull_request`-triggered workflow — that part of the policy is unchanged and still
absolute. The `qa_fixture_recorder.py` "Yes" rows above are GitHub Actions workflows too,
technically, but only ever execute on infrastructure this project itself owns and controls (§0) —
not a GitHub-hosted runner, and not reachable from a fork PR or any untrusted trigger.
`linux-graphical-session.yml`'s, `windows-graphical-session.yml`'s and `macos-graphical-session.yml`'s
rows are a different case:
they do run on a GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest`/`windows-latest`/`macos-latest` runner, same as
`build.yml`, but
never on `pull_request` (a fork PR can't trigger any of them), and the one secret each bakes in
(`TELEGRAM_API_ID`/`TELEGRAM_API_HASH`) is the same shared, non-per-account app identity `build.yml`
itself already bakes into every distributed release build on a GitHub-hosted runner — not a live
per-account third-party OAuth credential of the kind this policy exists to keep off
GitHub-hosted/`pull_request` infrastructure.
