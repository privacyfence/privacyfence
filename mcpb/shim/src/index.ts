/**
 * PrivacyFence .mcpb shim: a thin stdio-to-Streamable-HTTP transport proxy,
 * spawned by Claude Desktop exactly the way it used to spawn
 * privacyfence-bridge (mcpb/manifest.json.tmpl's server.mcp_config -- same
 * shape, only the staged file changed, see scripts/build_mcpb.sh). This is
 * what replaces the bridge for Desktop once tool calls go over /mcp (P2)
 * instead of the IPC socket.
 *
 * Unlike the bridge (bridge/src/index.ts), this process has no knowledge of
 * ToolSpec, no manifest fetch, no tool registration, and no JSON-RPC framing
 * of its own -- see proxy.ts's module docstring for why that's a deliberate
 * design constraint, not an oversight. Its whole job:
 *
 * 1. Wait for the daemon's /mcp endpoint to be reachable, launching
 *    privacyfence-app first if it isn't running yet (daemon.ts -- the one
 *    piece of the bridge whose job survives verbatim, per D11).
 * 2. Read the daemon's current /mcp URL and bearer token from the discovery
 *    files web/server.py and web/mcp_auth.py write (protocol.ts).
 * 3. Open a Streamable HTTP client connection to /mcp, authenticated by
 *    that bearer token.
 * 4. Proxy MCP frames between that connection and this process's own stdio
 *    transport (proxy.ts) -- Claude Desktop can now call tools, exactly as
 *    it could through the bridge.
 *
 * Logs go to stderr only (stdout is the MCP protocol channel) -- see
 * setupLogging(), same reasoning as bridge_main.py's original stderr-only
 * logging.StreamHandler setup.

/** Logs the flags this process was spawned with. ``--config`` is
 * daemon-side only, accepted here for CLI compatibility with how the bridge
 * was invoked; anything else is *ignored*, not rejected.
 *
 * Rejecting used to mean throwing out of main(), which exits before
 * desktopSide.start() has read a single byte of stdin. The failure that
 * produces is invisible from both sides at once: the host sees a server
 * process that started and then died without ever answering ``initialize``
 * (it reports a timeout, not a crash, since the spawn itself succeeded),
 * and because the shim never got as far as opening its ``/mcp`` connection,
 * the daemon's own log records nothing whatsoever -- no session, no
 * request, no error. A user reading privacyfence.log to find out why Claude
 * "cannot connect" finds an idle, healthy daemon and no trace of the
 * attempt.
 *
 * An MCP host owns the argv of the servers it spawns and may add flags of
 * its own at any time -- the same ``.mcpb`` launched a second way by a
 * newer client is the case this was found on. Refusing to start over an
 * argument this transport proxy has no use for anyway trades a working
 * connection for exactly that silent failure, so unrecognized flags are
 * logged to stderr (which the host captures into its own server log) and
 * otherwise ignored. */
