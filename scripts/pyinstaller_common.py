# PyInstaller `datas`/`hidden_imports` shared between PrivacyFenceApp.spec (macOS),
# PrivacyFenceApp.linux.spec (Linux), and PrivacyFenceApp.win.spec (Windows). All three specs
# build the same daemon entry point (src/_daemon_entry.py) against the same dependency set --
# the only things that differ between platforms are the packaging step around the PyInstaller
# output (BUNDLE() + .icns + codesign on macOS; a bare onedir + `debian/` packaging on Linux; a
# bare onedir + .ico + Inno Setup on Windows), not what goes into the frozen daemon itself.
# Factored out here instead of duplicated in three spec files so they can't quietly drift (a
# hidden import added for one platform but not the others, discovered only when that platform's
# build breaks).
#
# Every spec imports this the same way:
#
#   import sys
#   from pathlib import Path
#   sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "scripts"))
#   from pyinstaller_common import DATAS, HIDDEN_IMPORTS
#
# (PyInstaller execs spec files without the repo root's scripts/ on sys.path by default, hence the
# explicit insert rather than a plain top-level import.)
