"""Keep a protected branch's required-status-checks list in sync with the `.github/workflows/
tests.yml` jobs that actually run on every PR and are meant to gate correctness
(added by Phase 11 of the CI test-suite buildout -- see `docs/testing-policy.md`).

Targets `main` by default, but `--branch` also accepts a glob pattern such as `releases/**` --
CLAUDE.md's "Branching & PRs" section documents `releases/*` as a long-lived, cross-cycle
integration branch pattern (e.g. `releases/4.1-dev`) protected by its own ruleset the same way
`main` is. `REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECKS` is the same target list either way, since `tests.yml`'s push
trigger runs the identical jobs on both. Pass the pattern exactly as it appears in that ruleset's
`conditions.ref_name.include` (e.g. `--branch "releases/**"`) -- this script matches it verbatim
as `refs/heads/<branch>`, it does not itself expand or interpret the glob.

Branch protection is GitHub repo configuration this repo doesn't otherwise track as a file --
there's no commit history or diff to review for it, which is exactly why it silently falls behind
the workflow file as new jobs get added (a job promoted to per-PR in `tests.yml` doesn't, by
itself, make GitHub require it before a PR can merge). This script is the one place the *intended*
required set is written down, reviewable, and applied the same way every time, instead of an
implied setting someone edits once by hand in the web UI and never revisits.

**This talks to the repository *rulesets* API, not classic branch protection.** `main` is governed
by a repository ruleset (Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets), which is a different resource from the
classic `/branches/{branch}/protection` one an earlier version of this script used. The two are
evaluated together by GitHub but are stored separately, and the classic endpoint reports
`enforcement_level: "off"` with empty `contexts` on this repo *because no classic rule exists* --
not because nothing is enforcing. Reading the wrong one produces a confident false alarm: a code
review actually reported "branch protection is enforcing nothing" off exactly that response while
the ruleset was requiring all seven checks. If this script ever has to support a repo on classic
protection instead, add it as an explicit second code path -- do not quietly switch endpoints.

REQUIRED_STATUS_CHECKS below must be updated in the same PR as any change to which jobs
`tests.yml` runs on every PR, or to `test-python-compat`'s own Python-version matrix (each leg
reports as its own check, named from that job's `name:` template) -- see the comment above the
list for exactly what's included and why.

Usage:
    python scripts/update_branch_protection.py show
    python scripts/update_branch_protection.py apply [--dry-run]
    python scripts/update_branch_protection.py --branch "releases/**" show
    python scripts/update_branch_protection.py --branch "releases/**" apply [--dry-run]

Requires GITHUB_TOKEN in the environment: a token with admin rights on this repo's rulesets
(fine-grained "Administration: write", or classic `repo` scope on an org/repo admin's account).
Never run `apply` with a token you don't already trust to decide what blocks every future PR from
merging -- there is no CI job that runs this automatically, and there shouldn't be one: the target
list is a human, reviewed-in-PR decision, and applying it against the live repo is a separate,
deliberate step a maintainer takes after that PR merges.

# `continue-on-error: true` and so never turns the job red (Phase 11 exit criteria confirms this
# is a job-level, not step-level, mechanism), but its `ruff check .`, `bandit` and
# `scripts/mypy_strict_modules.py` steps are all blocking, so requiring the job means "require
# ruff, bandit, and mypy over every module the ratchet has promoted" (the rest of the tree stays
# informational until it gets the same per-module treatment -- see [tool.mypy] and its
# [[tool.mypy.overrides]] blocks in pyproject.toml).

#
# Also deliberately NOT included, for a different reason: `lockfile-freshness`, `pip-audit` and
# `npm-audit` (dependency-audit.yml), and `verify` (deploy-download-worker.yml). All four are
# meant to block and do run on `pull_request`, but only when the PR touches one of their
# workflow's own `paths:` filters (a dependency manifest; `cloudflare/downloads/**`) -- not
# unconditionally on every PR. Requiring a `paths:`-filtered job by name would wedge any PR that
# doesn't touch those paths: GitHub never sees that context reported at all for such a PR, and a
# required check that never reports blocks the merge indefinitely. Making one of these genuinely
# gating needs a job that always runs and short-circuits when the paths don't match, so the
# context always reports -- not an entry in this list. Revisit if any of those workflows ever
# drops its `paths:` filter.
