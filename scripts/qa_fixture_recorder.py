"""Local-only QA connector smoke-check and fixture recorder.

Run this on a developer's own machine only -- never in CI, never with any
credential provisioned to GitHub Actions or any other cloud service. It
reuses the exact OAuth token files ``privacyfence-app --<connector>-oauth``
already writes to the git-ignored ``credentials/`` directory
(``daemon_main.TOKEN_FILES``), and talks to your real, already-authenticated
accounts -- the same ones set up per ``docs/qa-environment-setup.md``.

Run with the project's own venv, not whatever ``python3`` is first on PATH --
this imports the same ``privacyfence`` package and third-party clients
(``google-api-python-client``, ``atlassian-python-api``, ``simple-salesforce``,
``telethon``, ...) the daemon does, none of which a bare system interpreter has:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/qa_fixture_recorder.py --check [connector ...]
        Calls each connector's read methods against its tagged seed
        artifact, asserts non-empty/expected results, prints a report.
        Never writes a fixture file. Safe to run any time, as often as
        you like.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/qa_fixture_recorder.py --record [connector ...]
        Does the same targeted calls, redacts real account-identity
        fields (author email, account id, display name -- see redact()
        below) and structural resource ids/URLs (deidentify_structural_
        fields() below), and writes the result to
        tests/fixtures/live/<connector>/<method>.json.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/qa_fixture_recorder.py --lifecycle [connector ...]
        For each write-capable connector that supports it (calendar,
        confluence, jira, tasks -- see the comment above LIFECYCLE_CHECKS
        below for why the other connectors aren't included), creates a
        fresh, uniquely-tagged QA object, reads it back, updates it, reads
        it back again, then deletes it and confirms the deletion actually
        took. Never touches a fixture file. Proves what --check/--record
        can't: that a real provider still accepts this codebase's own
        create_*/update_* calls, and that this scheduled job cleans up
        after itself instead of accumulating QA-account clutter forever.

Both --check/--record accept ``--report-file PATH`` to also save the printed
report, ready to paste into a PR description (see ``docs/testing-policy.md``
§2.1); so does --lifecycle.

Only reads from ``tests/fixtures/qa_environment.yaml`` -- a small, non-secret
manifest of your seed artifacts' IDs/keys/tags (see
``docs/qa-environment-setup.md``) -- ever decide *which* real object this
script is allowed to touch. If a fetched object's title/summary doesn't
carry the ``[QATEST]`` tag that manifest expects, recording is refused for
that item rather than silently capturing whatever was fetched.

    ``get_page(page_id)``: when ``_parse_page_v2`` isn't given a space_key
    (which the id-based path never is), it makes a *second* call to resolve
    the space's key from its id -- so the page fetch, the actual thing being
    recorded, gets silently clobbered by that trailing space lookup. Found
    the same way as Slack's analogous "which of several calls did I
    actually want" gap: by recording against a real account, not assumed
    safe. ``calls`` keeps every call in order so a caller that knows more
    than one might happen (Confluence's get_page) can pick the first one

    (``service.users().messages().get(...).execute()``) inline, with the
    ``.execute()`` call built fresh, on a new ``googleapiclient.http.
    HttpRequest`` instance, every time. There is no per-client method to
    monkeypatch the way ConfluenceClient/JiraClient/SalesforceClient have --
    so this patches ``HttpRequest.execute`` itself, at the class level, for
    the scope of the ``with`` block only.

    This is a real, verified mechanism, not a guess: offline (no network, no
    credentials), ``googleapiclient.discovery.build(..., static_discovery=
    True)`` returns a real ``HttpRequest`` from a real chained call, and
    ``HttpRequest.execute()`` genuinely routes through this patched method
    when called normally (no special args needed at the call site) -- see
    ``tests/unit/test_qa_fixture_recorder.py`` for that exact offline proof,
    built specifically because a MagicMock-based service double (the
    existing pattern in test_gmail_client.py etc.) never touches
    ``HttpRequest`` at all and so can't verify this class.

    Patching a third-party class method process-wide is a bigger lever than
    RawCapture/RawCaptureCall's instance-level monkeypatching, but the
    recorder is single-threaded and sequential (one connector, one call, at
    a time), so there's no concurrent caller to interfere with, and the

# Bounded lifecycle tests -- create a fresh, uniquely-tagged QA object, read it back,
# update it, read it back again, then (calendar/jira/tasks only -- see
# lifecycle_confluence's own docstring for why Confluence is the exception)
# delete it and confirm the deletion actually took. Unlike CONNECTOR_CHECKS
# above (which only ever reads a durable, hand-created seed artifact), this
# proves something neither --check nor --record can: that a real provider
# still accepts this codebase's own create_*/update_* calls as written --
# and, for calendar/jira/tasks, that this scheduled job cleans up after
# itself instead of quietly accumulating QA-account clutter, run after run,
# forever.
#
# Scoped to only the connectors whose PrivacyFence client exposes a full
# create/get/update triple:
#   - calendar, confluence, jira, tasks
# Deliberately excludes the rest of CONNECTOR_CHECKS's connectors, checked
# against each *_client.py before writing this rather than assumed:
#   - contacts -- ContactsClient.create_contact()'s own docstring says
#     "Contact deletion is not supported." Unlike Confluence below, there's
#     no update step either to make a create-and-leave-it-behind check worth
#     running on its own.
#   - gmail -- create_draft() has no matching get_draft()/update_draft() in
#     GmailClient, so there is no read/update step to exercise; creating and
#     immediately deleting a draft is not the create/read/update/delete
#     cycle this phase asks for.
#   - drive, slack -- both have write methods (create_blank_file/
#     write_sheet_values, send_message) but neither exposes the kind of
#     update-in-place-then-read-it-back pair the four connectors above do.
#     Left for a future extension of this section rather than forced into a
#     shape that doesn't fit.
#   - apps_script -- write_content() is a whole-file-set replace, so it
#     covers the update step, but AppsScriptClient exposes no way to create
#     a script project (no projects.create wrapper, and connectors/
#     apps_script.py registers no create tool), so there is no fresh,
#     uniquely-tagged object to make and tear down. The only thing a
#     lifecycle run could write to is the durable seed project itself --
#     overwriting the very artifact check_apps_script() reads, which is
#     exactly what this section's "never touch anything but what this run
#     just created" rule exists to prevent.
#   - salesforce, telegram -- SalesforceClient and the QA Telegram flow are
#     read-only from PrivacyFence's side (see CONNECTOR_CHECKS above); there
#     is nothing to create in the first place.
#
# None of calendar_client.py/confluence_client.py/jira_client.py/
# tasks_client.py expose a delete_*() method at all, and no connectors/*.py
# registers a delete tool for any provider -- a deliberate product-safety
# choice that nothing MCP-reachable ever deletes a user's real data. Cleanup here
# reaches past that boundary on purpose for calendar/jira/tasks, the same
# way RawCapture/RawCaptureExecute above reach into each client's internal
# request/service choke point: this script already runs with real QA-account
# credentials nothing else in this codebase is trusted with, and only ever
# touches the one object it just created itself this run (a fresh uuid4
# suffix every time, never a stored/durable id). Confluence is the one
# exception: deleting a page needs its own OAuth scope
# (delete:page:confluence) that atlassian_oauth.py deliberately never
# requests, on the same org-wide app every real user authenticates through
# -- broadening what that shared app can do just so this script can clean up
# after itself was considered and rejected. lifecycle_confluence() verifies
# create/get/update only and leaves the page behind; see its own docstring.

# Google's Calendar and Tasks APIs are eventually, not immediately, consistent

# finding isn't confused with that ordinary propagation delay. Jira doesn't
# get this treatment -- it has shown no such delay here, and retrying would

# deleted object at all -- Calendar keeps returning it with
# status: "cancelled", Tasks with deleted: true, and _confirm_deleted's
# is_deleted parameter (wired in lifecycle_calendar/lifecycle_tasks below)
# is the actual fix, not this budget. The ~27s window stays as real,
# legitimate propagation slack on top of that fix (is_deleted becoming true
# a beat later than the delete call returning is still possible in
# principle) -- this job's 20-minute timeout (connector-live-check.yml) has
# ample room for it, and in practice is_deleted is already true on the very
# first attempt (confirmed by that same run's logs), so this budget is no

    That second case exists because 06aeb29 widening this function's retry

    events.get on a just-deleted event keeps returning 200 with
    ``status: "cancelled"`` (every one of 10 attempts, 27s apart, came back
    byte-for-byte identical), and Tasks API's tasks.get on a just-deleted
    task returns 200 with ``deleted: true`` immediately, on the very first
    attempt -- Tasks tombstones rather than purges, and its ``status``
    field is completion state ("needsAction"/"completed"), unrelated to
    existence. No retry budget, however large, would ever turn either of
    those into a 404: the check itself needed the fix, not the budget.
    ``is_deleted`` is exactly that fix -- called on refetch()'s parsed
    return value (CalendarEvent.status == "cancelled", or Task.deleted)
    whenever refetch() doesn't raise.

    ``attempts`` > 1 retries (waiting ``delay_seconds`` between tries)
    before giving up -- kept even now that ``is_deleted`` exists, since a
    provider can still be genuinely eventually consistent on top of this
    (the object briefly still present at all, not just present-but-tagged-
    deleted). Callers for a provider known to be immediately consistent
    (e.g. Jira) should leave this at the default of one attempt: retrying
    there would only mask a real cleanup failure behind a few seconds of
    pointless waiting.

    every attempt before ``refetch`` itself -- diagnostic-only, same
    one-off purpose as _attempt_delete's ``request_desc`` above; this is
    what produced the evidence described above. Deliberately a *second*,
    separate call rather than reusing refetch's own result: the real client
    methods (get_event/get_task) parse the response into a dataclass, and
    seeing the exact raw body -- not just what is_deleted concluded from
    it -- is what let this get root-caused instead of just patched-around.
