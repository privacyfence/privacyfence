"""Publish release artifacts to the Cloudflare R2 release archive.

Replaces (and was rehearsed by) the one-off ".github/workflows/r2-smoke-test.yml" workflow --
that workflow proved the GitHub Actions -> R2 credentials/endpoint plumbing works and has been
deleted now that this script exists.

Every tagged release (stable and pre-release alike) uploads its artifacts here, laid out as:

    releases/
      stable/<version>/...
      beta/<version>/...
      alpha/<version>/...
      rc/<version>/...

"<version>" is __version__ as setuptools_scm resolves it from the git tag (see this repo's
CLAUDE.md "Releasing" section), e.g. "4.1.0" or "4.2.0b1" -- never the "v"-prefixed tag name
itself. The channel directory is derived from that version's PEP 440 pre-release suffix (a/b/rc,
same short spellings src/privacyfence/update_checker.py's _STAGE_RANK already uses to rank
update-check results); a version with no suffix is "stable".

This bucket is where alpha/beta/rc artifacts live *instead of* going anywhere public: unlike
stable, which also reaches PyPI and a public GitHub Release, pre-release tags stop at R2 --
see .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml and build.yml for exactly which channels reach which public
index. The bucket itself is left at Cloudflare R2's default (private, no public bucket policy or
custom domain) -- distributing an alpha/beta download link to testers is a separate, not-yet-
decided step, deliberately not automated by this script.

Stdlib + boto3 only (`pip install boto3`) -- no PrivacyFence install required, matching the other
release-time scripts in this directory (scripts/build_org_bundle.py, scripts/sync_room_directory.py).
This script deliberately doesn't import the ``privacyfence`` package for the same reason: it
carries its own copy of the version-parsing regex, mirroring update_checker.py's rather than
importing it, so a CI job can run it (e.g. the SBOM job in build.yml) without first installing the
full package.

Requires these environment variables (matching r2-smoke-test.yml's, before its deletion; renamed
from the original CF_R2_* to disambiguate from the download Worker's own CLOUDFLARE_* deploy
credentials -- see this repo's CLAUDE.md "Cloudflare R2 release archive" section):
    CF_RELEASES_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, CF_RELEASES_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  -- R2 API token
    CF_RELEASES_R2_ENDPOINT                                         -- R2 S3-compatible endpoint URL
    R2_BUCKET                                                       -- defaults to "privacyfence-releases"

Examples:
    python3 scripts/r2_release.py channel 4.2.0b1
        -> prints "beta"

    python3 scripts/r2_release.py upload --version 4.1.0 \\
        dist/PrivacyFence-4.1.0.dmg scripts/build_org_bundle.py scripts/sync_room_directory.py
        -> uploads each to releases/stable/4.1.0/<basename> in R2
