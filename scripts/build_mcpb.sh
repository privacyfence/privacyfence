# Build PrivacyFence's Claude Desktop extension — a one-click .mcpb install
# that registers an MCP server for PrivacyFence with no manual
# claude_desktop_config.json edits.
#
# Ships one file: PrivacyFence.mcpb — mcpb/shim/: talks to the daemon's
# /mcp Streamable HTTP endpoint, the only transport there is.
# Requires web.mcp.enabled in config/settings.yaml (on by default).
#
# A small Node/TypeScript MCP server with no connector clients, no PII
# detection, no PyObjC/AppKit — bundled by esbuild into a single
# dependency-free server/shim.js, so the .mcpb ships no Python framework
# and no node_modules/ directory. Claude Desktop supplies the Node runtime
# itself (server.type = "node" in the manifest). This script does NOT
# depend on build_dmg.sh.
#
# The extension still talks to the PrivacyFence daemon, so the daemon
# (PrivacyFenceApp.app, built separately by build_dmg.sh, still Python) must
# be installed and configured on its own — this bundle only wires up the MCP
# server entry.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   node + npm on PATH (npm installs mcpb/shim/'s build-time deps; npx runs
#   the @anthropic-ai/mcpb CLI).
#   pip install -e .   # PrivacyFence itself -- not built by this script, only
#                       # needed so VERSION below can read its installed
#                       # metadata (git-tag-derived, see this repo's
#                       # CLAUDE.md "Releasing" section).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build_mcpb.sh
#
# Output: dist/PrivacyFence-<version>.mcpb
