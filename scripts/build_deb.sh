# Build privacyfence_<version>_<arch>.deb — a `dpkg -i`-able Linux package wrapping a
# self-contained PyInstaller build of the daemon, the Linux equivalent of scripts/build_dmg.sh's
# macOS DMG. Key design decisions (not otherwise written up in a standing doc): PyInstaller instead
# of a "proper" python3-* dependency package, because several runtime dependencies aren't reliably
# available as compatible Debian archive packages and this project doesn't want to maintain a
# private APT repo just to have one; /opt/privacyfence + a thin /usr/bin/privacyfence-app wrapper,
# per Debian policy §9.1.2 for packages that don't integrate with the system package management
# for their internals; and an XDG autostart .desktop entry rather than the repo-root --user systemd
# unit (that unit stays the documented path for a bare pip/pipx install), because it works the same
# way across desktop environments and needs no per-user enablement step from a root-run postinst.
#
# Prerequisites (needed only on your build machine, not end-user machines):
#   pip install -e .        # PrivacyFence itself, so VERSION below can read its installed
#                            # metadata (git-tag-derived, see this repo's CLAUDE.md "Releasing")
#   pip install pyinstaller
#   apt-get install -y dpkg-dev lintian patchelf   # dpkg-deb ships with dpkg-dev; lintian and
#                                                   # patchelf are separate (see the RUNPATH
#                                                   # cleanup in the staging step below)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build_deb.sh
#
# Output: dist/privacyfence_<version>_<arch>.deb

# version string as-is -- the bare "a13" pre-release suffix and the "+g<sha>" local segment don't
# sort correctly under `dpkg --compare-versions`. Convert: a/b/rc -> ~a/~b/~rc (Debian's own
# "earlier than the following release" convention, e.g. "4.0.0~a13" sorts before "4.0.0"), and a
# dev build's ".devN+g<sha>" maps to "~devN+g<sha>" (sorts before the next real release this dev
# build is heading towards; the "+g<sha>" tail is carried through unchanged -- it's not itself
# meaningful to dpkg, only there so two dev builds of the same next-version don't collide).
#
# The regex below deliberately mirrors scripts/r2_release.py's _VERSION_RE rather than importing
# it -- same reasoning as that module's own docstring: this script has nothing else in common
