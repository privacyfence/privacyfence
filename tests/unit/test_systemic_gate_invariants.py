"""Systemic per-call-site invariants: extends
tests/unit/connectors/test_readme_manifest_alignment.py's
own parameterized, source-scanning pattern -- one assertion per tool/site,
generated from the real code rather than a hand-maintained list -- to four
more properties, none of which had a mechanical regression
guard before this module existed:

- Every gated tool (``auto_accept.TOOL_TO_GATE[tool] != "auto"``) declares a
  required ``"reason"`` ``ToolParam`` -- gate.py's own module comment: "Every
  gated tool's ToolSpec declares a required reason param so Claude['s]..."
  (see gate.py's ``reason_scope``/``current_reason`` docstrings). Without
  this param, ``web/mcp_dispatch.py``'s ``McpDispatcher.call()`` still runs
  fine (``args.pop("reason", "")`` defaults to ``""``), so a missing
  declaration is a silent capability loss (no reason ever recorded for that
  tool's audit trail), not a crash -- exactly the kind of gap a parametrized
  test catches and an ad hoc code read doesn't.
- Every ``gate="review"`` ``gated_call()`` site passes ``pii_scan_text`` --
  gate.py's module docstring: content-only text so the real PII scan isn't
  run against unavoidable structural envelope metadata (an email's From/To,
  a chat message's channel/sender, a page's author) present on *every*
  single read, which "will otherwise make the PII gate fire on essentially
  every read." A short, individually-justified exemption list
  (``_PII_SCAN_TEXT_EXEMPT`` below) covers the few tools whose
  ``details_text`` is already pure record/content with no separate envelope
  layer to strip -- documented rather than silently excluded, per this
  repo's own "where the codebase is inconsistent, call it out explicitly"
  convention (docs/coding-and-testing-guidelines.md).
- All ten remaining credential/token-file writers across the
  ``*_client.py``/``*_oauth.py`` modules go through ``secure_files.py``'s
  ``atomic_write_text``/``atomic_write_json`` rather than a hand-rolled
  ``open()``/``.write()`` -- the SEC-09 invariant (secure_files.py's own
  module docstring) checked per call site here, rather than trusted to have
  been done once at each site and stay that way. (Eleven at the time the
  review was written; see ``TOKEN_WRITE_SITES``'s own comment for why
  ``room_directory_client.py``'s site doesn't count against this specific
  check anymore -- it's still covered, just separately.)
- Nothing that decides a gated call -- a ``CONDITION_SELECTORS`` entry,
  ``auto_accept.ReviewContext``, any ``policy/`` module -- reads agent
  identity: ADR 0006 Invariant 1, a claimed identity never changes an
  outcome (see ``TestNoOutcomeKeysOnAgentIdentity``).
