"""Canonical cross-platform system test (docs/testing-policy.md's layer-3
canonical scenario): one real daemon -> MCP -> approval -> audit scenario, proven
identical on ``ubuntu-latest``, ``windows-latest``, and ``macos-latest`` --
no new CI wiring needed for that (``pyproject.toml``'s ``testpaths =
["tests"]`` already collects this module wherever the full suite already
runs, same as ``tests/platform/``).

Deliberately combines two patterns this repo already has, rather than
reinventing either:

- **Real process boundary** -- tests/platform/test_daemon_process_lifecycle.py's
  spawn technique: ``python -c <bootstrap>`` monkeypatches
  ``privacyfence.paths.data_dir`` to an isolated sandbox *before*
  ``privacyfence.daemon_main`` is ever imported, then runs the real
  ``daemon_main.main([])`` entry point as a genuinely separate OS process --
  the same one a systemd unit/LaunchAgent/mcpb shim spawn call would run.
  Every other daemon/MCP/approval test in this repo (including
  test_mcp_daemon_contract.py and test_deferred_approval_round_trip.py)
  drives ``WebServer``/``daemon_main`` functions as a plain in-process call;
  this is the one system-level scenario that also proves the process
  *boundary* itself -- real socket bind, real ``mcp_url``/lock-file
  discovery, a real HTTP round trip from a separate process, real clean
  shutdown -- identically across all three OSes.
- **MCP client + deferred-approval protocol** -- the official ``mcp`` Python
  client (test_mcp_daemon_contract.py) driving the real deferred-approval
  round trip (test_deferred_approval_round_trip.py: hold-window elapses ->
  ``approval_pending`` -> a real HTTP decide -> a second identical call
  finds the ledger and releases). Since this test's daemon is a real
  subprocess (not an in-process ``WebServer``), there is no shared Python
  object to hand a synthetic connector to the way those two in-process
  tests do -- so the bootstrap script below defines its own minimal
  ``Connector`` (same shape as test_deferred_approval_round_trip.py's own
  ``GatedTestConnector``, necessarily reproduced rather than imported since
  it has to exist inside the spawned process's own ``-c`` script) and
  monkeypatches ``daemon_main.build_connectors`` to return it instead of the
  real, credential-backed connector set -- no live provider needed, same as
  every other daemon/MCP test in this repo.

What's genuinely new here versus the modules above: a real daemon *process*
speaking the full contract end to end -- ``/mcp`` tool discovery and a
gated call, the real ``/approvals``/``/settings`` web surfaces reached via
a real one-time bootstrap exchange (``POST /api/bootstrap`` plus the real
``?bootstrap=`` redirect -- not a directly-constructed session, the way
test_deferred_approval_round_trip.py's own ``_decide`` helper takes a
shortcut only available in-process; see ``_bootstrap_session``'s own
docstring for why this mints its own code via that endpoint rather than
reading the link the daemon logs at startup), a real Allow and a real Deny
each resolved through that HTTP surface, the audit log inspected from disk
afterwards, and a graceful shutdown via the real
``POST /api/settings/quit_app`` action (proc.terminate()/SIGTERM, as
test_daemon_process_lifecycle.py's own termination test uses, does not
reliably exercise the same code path -- see run_app()'s own ``finally``
block, which only runs when ``_wait_for_shutdown()`` returns normally).

Cross-platform assertions are deliberately light on top of the shared
scenario -- OS-level path/lock/process coverage lives under
``tests/platform/`` (state/config path
resolution, secure-directory creation, single-instance locking across a
real process boundary, daemon process spawning/discovery/cleanup);
duplicating any of that here would be pure churn. What this module adds on
top is the one thing tests/platform/ deliberately doesn't cover: that the
secure-directory permission floor (secure_files.py's ``secure_mkdir``) that backs
every one of those state paths is actually in effect on the *audit log*
directory this exact scenario just wrote to, on every POSIX OS this runs
on (skipped on Windows, where ``Path.chmod`` doesn't carry the same
meaning -- same posture as every other POSIX-only permission assertion in
this repo, e.g. tests/unit/test_secure_files.py's own).
