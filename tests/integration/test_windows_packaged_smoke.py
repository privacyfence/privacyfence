"""Packaged-artifact lifecycle test for the Windows installer.

The same role ``tests/integration/test_macos_packaged_smoke.py`` (TST-15)
plays for the DMG and ``tests/integration/test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``
(Phase 6.3) plays for the ``.deb``: install the actual built artifact -- not
a source checkout, not an editable dev install -- and exercise it as closely
as possible to how a real user would.

1. **Install**: a real silent run of ``scripts/build_installer.ps1``'s
   ``dist/PrivacyFence-<version>-setup.exe`` (Inno Setup 6) --
   ``/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES``, same as a user clicking through the
   wizard with every default accepted. ``/DIR=`` is overridden to a scratch
   directory under this test's own ``tmp_path`` rather than the real
   ``%ProgramFiles%`` purely for isolation from whatever else is on the
   runner, not to dodge elevation: ``installer/privacyfence.iss`` is
   ``PrivilegesRequired=admin`` (a non-elevated install can never register
   the Task Scheduler autostart task at all -- see
   ``docs/platform-support.md``'s "Known open items" -- so admin is no
   longer optional), and this test relies on the hosted runner's own account
   already carrying a full, unfiltered admin token (no interactive UAC
   prompt to get in this test's way) rather than on the installer not
   needing one.
2. **Validate the autostart entry**: ``installer/privacyfence.iss``'s
   ``[Run]`` section registers the Task Scheduler task as part of the
   (silent) install itself, not a separate opt-in step -- ``schtasks /query`` against it is
   the one thing that would silently no-op at next logon if the install step
   ever stopped wiring it up.
3. **Start the real installed daemon** (``privacyfence-app.exe``, not
   ``PrivacyFenceApp.exe`` directly -- the same alias name both the Task
   Scheduler task and the mcpb shim's own ``DEFAULT_APP_PATH`` look for, see
   ``build_installer.ps1`` step 4) and run the Phase 3
   (``tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py``) daemon -> MCP -> approval ->
   audit contract's own shape against it: a real bootstrap session, an MCP
   tool call resolved through the real HTTP decide route both Allow and
   Deny, the audit log read back from disk, and a graceful shutdown via the
   real "Quit PrivacyFence" action.

   **One deliberate substitution** from Phase 3's own scenario, for the same
   reason ``test_macos_packaged_smoke.py``/``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``
   already made it: Phase 3 injects a synthetic ``Connector`` by
   monkeypatching ``daemon_main.build_connectors`` *before* ``daemon_main``
   is ever imported -- only possible when the test controls the Python
   import itself, which a packaged, frozen daemon started as its own binary
   never does. This module instead drives
   ``privacyfence_propose_auto_accept_rule_change``, the one built-in
   meta-tool that always blocks on a confirmation dialog with no
   connector/credential of any kind behind it -- same tool, same reasoning.
   Like ``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py`` (and unlike the macOS module's
   real headless-Chromium click), this one resolves the pending card via a
   direct HTTP POST to ``/api/approvals/<id>/decide`` with the
   bootstrap-minted session cookie as CSRF -- no Node/Playwright dependency
   needed here, keeping this job's prerequisites to exactly what
   ``scripts/build_installer.ps1`` itself already needs.
4. **Uninstall**: a real silent run of the installer's own generated
   ``unins000.exe`` -- package-owned files (the whole install directory) and
   the Task Scheduler task (removed by the ``.iss``'s own
   ``[UninstallRun]``) are gone afterward; per-user state under the
   isolated ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PrivacyFence\\`` this test pointed the daemon
   at is untouched (``installer/privacyfence.iss``'s own ``[UninstallDelete]``
   comment: the installer never reaches into that directory at all).
5. **Upgrade in place** (this plan's Phase 6 item 20 -- deliberately not built
   in the same PR as items 1-4 above): install version N, use it to create
   real on-disk state (an applied auto-accept rule, via the same MCP round
   trip as step 3), install a synthetically-bumped version N+1 -- the
   identical PyInstaller ``dist/PrivacyFenceApp`` onedir output, re-packaged
   through a second, separate ``iscc.exe`` invocation with a bumped
   ``/DAppVersion`` (same technique ``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``'s
   ``_synthetic_next_version_deb`` already uses for the ``.deb``: a second
   genuine PyInstaller build just for a "real" N+1 would multiply this
   module's already-heavy setup cost for no additional coverage of a claim
   that doesn't depend on what changed *inside* the package) -- over it, at
   the same install directory, and confirms the state survived and the
   upgraded binary still starts and serves. ``installer/privacyfence.iss``'s
   fixed ``AppId`` is what makes this a real in-place-upgrade install rather
   than a side-by-side one, the same way a second real release's installer
   would behave against a machine that already has PrivacyFence installed.

Skipped entirely unless running on real Windows with a just-built
``dist/PrivacyFence-*-setup.exe`` on disk -- this only makes sense as a step
in ``.github/workflows/build.yml``'s ``build-windows`` job, right after
``scripts/build_installer.ps1``, never as part of the ordinary ``pytest``
invocation in ``tests.yml``'s per-PR jobs (same posture as the macOS/Linux
packaged tests). Step 5's upgrade test additionally needs ``iscc.exe`` on
``PATH`` and ``dist/PrivacyFenceApp``/``build/privacyfence.ico`` on disk --
both already there right after ``scripts/build_installer.ps1``'s own steps
3/1, the same prerequisites the first ``iscc.exe`` invocation (step 7) used
to build ``setup_exe`` in the first place.

    version string guaranteed different from the original -- a second
    genuine ``iscc.exe`` invocation, not a repackaged copy of ``setup_exe``
    itself, since Inno Setup's own compiler is what actually needs to run
    twice to prove anything (unlike ``dpkg-deb --build``, there's no cheap
    way to relabel an already-compiled ``.exe`` after the fact). This is the
    same *inputs* as ``scripts/build_installer.ps1``'s own step 7, just
    invoked a second time with a bumped ``/DAppVersion`` and a scratch
    ``/DOutputDir`` -- deliberately not a real second PyInstaller build (see
    this module's own docstring, step 5, for why that would only add cost,
    not coverage, for what this test needs proven).

    Unlike ``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``'s ``_synthetic_next_version_deb``,
    the version string here doesn't need to be *orderable* as "newer" --
    Inno Setup's own upgrade-detection keys off ``AppId`` (fixed in
    ``installer/privacyfence.iss``), not a version comparison, so any
    different ``AppVersion`` string is enough to prove this is a distinct
    reinstall rather than the identical bytes being re-applied.
