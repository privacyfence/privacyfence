"""Real Task Scheduler autostart verification for the Windows installer.
See `docs/platform-support.md`'s "Known open items" for the full history of
this verification -- the real Task Scheduler XML definition, the
crash-restart-on-failure behavior, and what still can't be observed from a
hosted CI runner.

``test_windows_packaged_smoke.py`` (Phase 6.2) already proves the installer
registers *a* Task Scheduler autostart task (``schtasks /query`` against it)
and that the alias exe it points at, once started, serves a real
daemon/MCP/approval/audit round trip -- but it starts that alias exe itself,
directly, as a subprocess, out of that test's own ``tmp_path``. Nothing
there ever asks Task Scheduler to run anything, and nothing there looks at
what the task actually says.

This module does both:

1. **The registered definition matches the autostart contract.** Not the
   template file in this repo -- the definition read back out of Task
   Scheduler itself (``schtasks /query /xml``), i.e. what the service
   actually parsed, normalized and stored: a ``LogonTrigger`` with no
   ``UserId`` (so it is scoped to any interactive logon, not the installing
   account), a ``Builtin\\Users`` principal bound to the ``Actions`` element
   by a matching ``id``/``Context`` pair, ``LeastPrivilege``, ``Parallel``
   multiple-instances, the real installed ``privacyfence-app.exe`` path as
   the action's ``Command``, the ``RestartOnFailure`` interval/count, and the
   two battery settings that would otherwise default to "don't start on
   battery power". Each of those has been a real,
   shipped bug at least once -- see ``installer/privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl``'s
   own header comment -- and every one of them was invisible to a test that
   only asked "does a task with this name exist". The same contract is
   asserted against the shipped template on every PR, on any OS, by
   ``tests/unit/test_windows_autostart_task_template.py``; both call
   ``tests/windows_task_contract.py``.
2. **Task Scheduler really starts the daemon.** The service is asked to run
   the installed task; the process it launches is confirmed to be the
   installed exe, running as the logged-on user (``Win32_Process``'s
   ``GetOwner``, not assumed), serving the Phase 3 daemon/MCP/approval/audit
   contract, and ending on "Quit PrivacyFence". This is also what found the
   defect that had kept Windows autostart from ever working: started with no
   console, the windowed build had no ``sys.stdout`` for uvicorn's log
   formatter to probe, and the daemon exited 1 before binding its port (see
   ``privacyfence/std_streams.py``). Every other automated start of this app
   in this repo hands it a redirected stdout, so nothing else could have.
3. **Real crash-restart** (Phase 13 item 4). The second test kills the
   Scheduler-started daemon outright and asserts that a *new* pid turns up,
   still running as the same signed-in account, with no further action from
   this test. This is the positive assertion a first measurement pass could
   not make: killing the action showed ``<RestartOnFailure>`` does nothing
   for a crashed daemon at all (Task Scheduler logs the dead action as a
   *successfully completed* task, so the setting never engages), which is
   why real crash-restart is a repeating ``<TimeTrigger>`` instead -- see
   ``installer/privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl``'s own header comment for that
   design and ``platform-support.md``'s "Known open items" for the
   measurement that found ``<RestartOnFailure>`` did not work. This test is
   the direct successor of, and replaces, the negative assertion this
   module used to carry (``test_restart_on_failure_does_not_cover_a_
   crashed_daemon``, preserved in git history) once that measurement made
   the positive assertion provable.

**The one deliberate substitution, and the history behind it.** Task
Scheduler is asked to run the task *on demand* rather than by a user signing
in. ``AllowStartOnDemand`` and the trigger share every step that follows the
decision to run -- resolving the ``Builtin\\Users`` principal to a concrete
logged-on member, running the action with that member's ``LeastPrivilege``
token, in their profile -- so everything above is the real mechanism. What
it does not cover is the trigger's own firing, i.e. Task Scheduler deciding
*when*.

That gap is deliberate, and it replaces a substitution that could not work.
This module used to create a throwaway local account, call PowerShell's
``Start-Process -Credential`` for it, call that "signing in", and assert the
daemon turned up. It never did, on any run: ``CreateProcessWithLogonW``
(what that cmdlet, and ``runas.exe``, are built on) creates a *logon
session* but not the Terminal Services *session* logon that Task Scheduler's
``LogonTrigger`` subscribes to, so the trigger was never evaluated at all.
Task Scheduler said so itself once the failure message started asking it --
run 24 of ``windows-graphical-session.yml``, against ``main``, with the task
correctly registered::

    Status:                Ready
    Scheduled Task State:  Enabled
    Run As User:           Users
    Last Run Time:         11/30/1999 12:00:00 AM
    Last Result:           267011        (SCHED_S_TASK_HAS_NOT_RUN)

Registered, enabled, ready, never attempted. Nothing was wrong on the
installer side; the test was asserting something a hosted runner cannot
produce. So the trigger's own firing is now covered where it can actually be
covered: ``release-testing.md``'s Windows human checks, on a real machine
with a real sign-in, tracked on
`privacyfence/privacyfence#121 <https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/121>`_.
(An RDP loopback into the runner would create a genuine session logon, and
was considered -- it needs an RDP client that can run without a desktop of
its own, which a hosted runner does not have, so it would trade a gap that
is honestly described for one that is merely harder to see.)

The throwaway account is gone with it, for a reason worth stating because it
is a property of the shipped task rather than of the test: a task whose
principal is a *group* runs with the interactive token of a member who is
**signed in**, and the daemon lands in that member's own profile. On a
hosted runner exactly one account has a real interactive session -- the
runner's own -- so that is the account this module can have the task run
for, and a throwaway account (which, as above, cannot be given a session at
all) buys nothing. Run 25 showed the same thing from the other side: asking
for the run as that throwaway account returned ``ERROR: Access is denied.``

So, like ``test_linux_graphical_session_autostart.py`` and unlike every
other packaged test in this repo, this module does **not** isolate the
daemon's home directory under ``tmp_path``: Task Scheduler starts the daemon
with no injected environment, in the real profile of the real logged-on
account, which is the whole point. It refuses to run at all (skips) if that
account already has PrivacyFence state, and removes whatever it creates
afterwards -- see ``_real_home_state``. **Only ever run this against a
disposable CI account.**

The install also goes to a machine-wide directory rather than the
installer's own default. ``installer/privacyfence.iss`` is
``PrivilegesRequired=lowest``, so a silent install resolves ``{autopf}`` to
``{userpf}`` -- ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\PrivacyFence``, inside the
installing account's profile, which no *other* account can read. The shipped
task's ``Builtin\\Users`` principal only composes with a per-machine layout,
so that is what this test installs (see ``INSTALL_DIR``).

Skipped entirely unless running on real Windows, elevated (installing
machine-wide and managing a Task Scheduler task needs it), with a just-built
``dist/PrivacyFence-*-setup.exe`` on disk -- same posture as
``test_windows_packaged_smoke.py``, and, like the Linux module, run from its
own ``.github/workflows/windows-graphical-session.yml`` (packaging-related
``main`` pushes, weekly, and on demand) rather than ``build.yml``'s
tag-triggered release pipeline or ``tests.yml``'s per-PR jobs: this is the
same flakiest-and-most-expensive tier in ``docs/automated-test-strategy-
plan.md``'s taxonomy (Phase 7's own objective) the Linux module already
lives in, so a flaky run here must never block an actual release. The module
and workflow keep their "graphical session" names, which now read as the
tier they belong to rather than a literal description of what this module
drives -- renaming them would break the workflow's own run history and
``paths:`` triggers for no gain.
