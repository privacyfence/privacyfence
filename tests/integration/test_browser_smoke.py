"""Small, always-on Playwright suite driving the real web approval surface
in a real headless browser.

Every other test of this surface (tests/unit/web/) drives it through either
``starlette.testclient.TestClient`` (an in-process ASGI transport, no real
socket -- see test_routes_approvals.py's own docstring) or, for the MCP
endpoint, a real socket but a scripted client (tests/integration/
test_mcp_daemon_contract.py). Neither exercises what only a real browser
actually does: parses and enforces the ``Content-Security-Policy`` header,
applies real cookie ``SameSite`` semantics to a real ``fetch()``, runs the
page's own JS event loop (SSE ``EventSource``, ``navigator.credentials``),
and lays out a real DOM. web/routes_approvals.py's own ``TestInjectShim``
class documents exactly the kind of bug that gap allowed through once
already: "a real bug found by actually clicking Allow in headless
Chromium... found by actually driving a served card in headless Chromium
and clicking Allow." This module is that manual repro, made permanent.

Requires the ``playwright`` package (test-only, see pyproject.toml's
``[project.optional-dependencies].test``) *and* a downloaded Chromium
build (``playwright install chromium``); skipped automatically if either
is missing, same posture test_shim_mcp_contract.py takes for a missing
Node binary -- this suite is "always-on" in the sense that CI always has
both (see .github/workflows/tests.yml's ``Install Playwright browsers``
step), not that it forces every contributor's machine to.

Two checks need a real browser because ``TestClient`` does not enforce
CSP: that no inline script runs without its nonce, and that the PDF
preview actually renders (the card's ``<embed>`` is blocked by the
implicit ``default-src 'none'`` fallback unless the policy names
``object-src``/``frame-src`` exceptions). Both assert real pass/fail
outcomes -- see ``TestSecurityHeadersCsp``/``TestPdfPreview`` below, and
web/csp.py's ``build_csp()`` for the policy they check (ADR 0063).
