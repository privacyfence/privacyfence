"""Packaged-artifact lifecycle test for the Linux ``.deb``
(the now-removed automated-test-strategy-plan.md Phase 6 item 6.3; the now-removed linux-local-deb-
packaging-plan.md P7.1/P7.3).

The now-removed ``linux-local-deb-packaging-plan.md`` Phase 7 already proved this
lifecycle by hand once (P7.1: install/validate/remove/purge; P7.3, partially:
reinstalling the same build over itself leaves ``$HOME`` alone). This module
turns that into a repeatable CI job, the same role
``tests/integration/test_macos_packaged_smoke.py`` (TST-15) already plays for
the DMG: install the actual built artifact, not a source checkout or an
editable dev install, and exercise it as closely as possible to how a real
user would.

1. **Install**: real ``dpkg -i`` against the ``.deb`` ``scripts/build_deb.sh``
   just produced -- not `--target`, not a source checkout (contrast
   ``test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py``'s own "Why a --target install, not
   the .deb" docstring section: that module deliberately avoids the ``.deb``
   because its own layer doesn't need it; this module's whole point is that
   the ``.deb`` specifically is what's being proven).
2. **Validate the autostart entry**: ``desktop-file-validate`` against the
   installed ``/etc/xdg/autostart/privacyfence.desktop`` -- the one thing a
   malformed ``.desktop`` file would silently no-op on at the next graphical
   login rather than fail loudly, so this is the one place that would catch
   it before release.
3. **Start the real installed daemon** (``/usr/bin/privacyfence-app``, the
   wrapper ``debian/install`` puts on ``PATH`` -- not the PyInstaller onedir
   output directly, so this also proves the wrapper script itself works) and
   run the Phase 3 (``tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py``) daemon → MCP
   → approval → audit contract's own shape against it: a real bootstrap
   session, an MCP tool call resolved through the real HTTP decide route
   both Allow and Deny, the audit log read back from disk, and a graceful
   shutdown via the real "Quit PrivacyFence" action.

   **One deliberate substitution** from Phase 3's own scenario, for the same
   reason ``test_macos_packaged_smoke.py`` already made it: Phase 3 injects a
   synthetic ``Connector`` by monkeypatching ``daemon_main.build_connectors``
   *before* ``daemon_main`` is ever imported -- only possible when the test
   controls the Python import itself. A packaged, frozen daemon started as
   its own binary offers no such hook. This module instead drives
   ``privacyfence_propose_auto_accept_rule_change``, the one built-in
   meta-tool that "ALWAYS blocks on a native confirmation dialog" with no
   connector/credential of any kind behind it (see that tool's own
   description in ``web/mcp_tools.py``) -- same reasoning
   ``test_macos_packaged_smoke.py``'s own docstring gives for the identical
   choice. Unlike that module (which drives a real headless-Chromium click),
   this one resolves the pending card the same way Phase 3 itself does: a
   direct HTTP POST to ``/api/approvals/<id>/decide`` with the bootstrap-
   minted session cookie doubling as the CSRF token -- no Node/Playwright
   dependency needed here, keeping this job's prerequisites to exactly what
   ``scripts/build_deb.sh`` itself already needs (Python + ``dpkg``/
   ``lintian``).
4. **Remove** (``dpkg -r``): package-owned files gone
   (``/opt/privacyfence``, ``/usr/bin/privacyfence-app``); the autostart
   ``.desktop`` file -- a ``conffile`` -- deliberately survives a plain
   remove (dpkg's own conffile contract); ``$HOME``'s state is untouched
   (P2.2's "the package never reaches into `$HOME`" contract).
5. **Purge** (``dpkg -P``): the conffile is now gone too; ``$HOME`` is still
   untouched.
6. **Upgrade in place** (P7.3): install version N, use it to create real
   on-disk state (an applied auto-accept rule, via the same MCP round trip
   as step 3), install a synthetically-bumped version N+1 of the identical
   build over it, confirm the state survived and the upgraded binary still
   starts and serves. Building a genuine second PyInstaller bundle just to
   get a "real" N+1 for this one assertion would multiply this module's
   already-heavy setup cost for no additional coverage (the file-level
   ``$HOME`` isolation this proves doesn't depend on what changed inside the
   package) -- see ``_synthetic_next_version_deb``'s own docstring for why a
   version-string bump on the same build is sufficient here, closing the
   exact gap P7.3's own "partially checked" note (which only re-installed
   the *identical* version) left open: a real version transition, not just a
   reinstall.

Skipped entirely unless running on real Linux with a just-built ``.deb`` on
disk, ``dpkg``/``dpkg-deb``/``desktop-file-validate`` on ``PATH``, and
passwordless root (via ``sudo -n``, or already running as root) -- installing
and removing a package needs it. This only makes sense as a step in
``.github/workflows/build.yml``'s ``build-deb`` job, right after
``scripts/build_deb.sh`` -- never runs as part of the ordinary ``pytest``
invocation in ``tests.yml``'s per-PR jobs, same posture as
``test_macos_packaged_smoke.py``.
