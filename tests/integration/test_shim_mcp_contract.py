"""Cross-language contract test for the .mcpb shim (D11): does the real
Node shim (mcpb/shim/) actually speak Streamable HTTP to the real Python
``/mcp`` endpoint?

This is the shim's counterpart to test_bridge_daemon_contract.py -- same
reasoning, same shape (spawn the real built artifact, drive it with the
official ``mcp`` Python client over real stdio, assert the round trip
worked), a different transport underneath: a much smaller Node-side test
that drives the shim's stdio transport with the mcp client against a real
/mcp, asserting that one initialize and one tools/call make the round trip
with the bearer header attached and the mcp_url file honoured. That is a
passthrough test, not a schema test: the shim knows no schemas, so there is
nothing else to assert.

Requires Node on PATH; skipped automatically otherwise -- same posture as
test_bridge_daemon_contract.py, and for the same reason this lives under
tests/integration/ rather than tests/unit/. Also requires the `mcp` package
(test-only, see pyproject.toml's [project.optional-dependencies].test).
