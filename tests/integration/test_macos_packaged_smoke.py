"""Release-workflow smoke test against the actual packaged macOS artifact
(TST-15).

Every other test in this repo runs against source -- an editable install, or
(tests/integration/test_shim_mcp_contract.py) a freshly-built dist/shim.js
run straight from mcpb/shim/. None of that proves the thing end users
actually download -- ``dist/PrivacyFence-<version>.dmg``, produced by
``scripts/build_dmg.sh`` via PyInstaller (``PrivacyFenceApp.spec``) -- is
correctly laid out, actually starts, and actually speaks MCP once bundled.
PyInstaller's own module-discovery pass has silently dropped a package
before (a hidden import, a missing data file) in a way no source-tree test
can catch, since a source-tree test never leaves the interpreter that
already knows how to import everything.

This is deliberately narrow -- one round trip, not a real test suite for
the packaged app:

1. **Install**: mount the just-built DMG (``hdiutil attach``) and copy
   ``PrivacyFenceApp.app`` out of it, the way dragging it to ``/Applications``
   would -- minus actually writing to a shared runner's ``/Applications``,
   which direct execution of the bundle's own binary doesn't require (see
   ``running_packaged_daemon`` below).
2. **Start the daemon**: run the frozen binary directly (not via
   ``open``/Finder -- that's what would invoke Gatekeeper, which a bundle
   built and immediately run on this same machine was never quarantined
   for in the first place) with an isolated ``$HOME``, then mint a
   bootstrap link the same way a human with filesystem access to this
   machine but no daemon-log line handy would (through the #428 Phase 2
   control channel -- a real Unix domain socket against this daemon's own
   data directory, via ``tests.control_channel_client`` -- see
   ``running_packaged_daemon`` below for why this, and not scraping the
   daemon's own stdout, is the only reliable way to get one: SEC-10's
   ``SecretRedactingFormatter`` redacts a ``bootstrap=<value>`` substring
   from every log line on principle, the startup line included).
3. **Connect via the MCP shim**: build and spawn the real
   ``mcpb/shim/dist/shim.js`` (same artifact Claude Desktop would run) over
   real stdio, exactly like test_shim_mcp_contract.py, pointed at the
   already-running daemon via the same ``$HOME``.
4. **Open the approval UI**: a real headless-Chromium page follows the
   bootstrap link (SEC-06), landing signed in on ``/approvals``.
5. **One synthetic Allow/Deny round trip**: call
   ``privacyfence_propose_auto_accept_rule_change`` (the one meta-tool that
   always opens a confirmation popup, so this needs no connector OAuth setup
   at all) over MCP, click "Confirm" on the real served card from the real
   browser, and assert the MCP call the whole time was blocked on returns
   the confirmed result once that happens.
6. **State lives outside the package**: delete the installed
   ``PrivacyFenceApp.app`` -- the actual "uninstall" gesture on macOS (drag
   to Trash; there's no installer/uninstaller pair the way Windows/Linux
   have) -- and confirm the rule change from step 5 is still on disk under
   ``$HOME/.privacyfence``, the same "user state survives package removal"
   property ``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``/``test_windows_packaged_
   smoke.py`` assert for their own platforms' removal gesture.
7. **Signature/notarization**: when the DMG was built with ``--sign``/
   ``NOTARIZE_PROFILE`` (as ``build.yml``'s release job always does; a local
   unsigned dev build is legitimate and skips this instead of failing it),
   verify the installed bundle's code-signature chain (``codesign
   --verify --deep --strict``), that it's actually signed by a real
   Developer ID identity rather than ad-hoc, that Gatekeeper's own policy
   engine would accept it (``spctl --assess --type execute``), and that the
   DMG itself carries a stapled notarization ticket. This proves the
   artifact's Gatekeeper story automatically; the interactive first-launch
   "are you sure you want to open this" dialog a human actually sees stays
   manual, per this plan's own governing rule. Runs against its own private
   copy of the bundle (``signed_app_copy``), not the one step 6 deletes --
   see that fixture's own docstring for why.
8. **Upgrade in place** (deliberately not built in the same PR as steps 1-7): install
   version N, apply real state through the daemon's own MCP surface,
   replace the bundle with a synthetically-relabeled version N+1 at the
   same ``$HOME`` (step 6 already established that "installing" a new
   version here is just replacing the ``.app`` bundle wholesale), and
   confirm the state survived and the new bundle still starts and serves.
   Its own MCP round trip is the lighter direct-``/mcp``-plus-HTTP-decide
   substitution ``test_deb_packaged_lifecycle.py``/``test_windows_packaged_
   smoke.py`` already use for their own scenarios, not steps 3-5's real
   shim/browser -- the shim artifact itself is already proven by steps 1-5;
   this step's own job is proving state survival across a bundle swap.

Skipped entirely unless running on real macOS with a just-built DMG on disk
(this only makes sense as a step in ``.github/workflows/build.yml``'s
``build`` job, right after ``scripts/build_dmg.sh`` -- see that workflow's
"Run packaged smoke test" step) and Node/the ``mcp``/``playwright`` test
extras available -- never runs as part of the ordinary ``pytest`` invocation
in tests.yml's ubuntu-latest job.

    (``paths.data_dir()`` resolves through ``Path.home()`` for a bundled

    filesystem access (no live log line) would use is both correct in the
