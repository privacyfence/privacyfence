"""Release-workflow smoke test for the Ubuntu org-mode service (TST-16),
later extended with app-level authz-policy coverage, an approval exercised
with audit-principal correctness, and persisted state surviving a restart
(see the classes/tests below for what each covers and why), and promoted
from dispatch/tag-only to a permanent per-PR CI job.

Every other org-mode test in this repo (tests/unit/web/test_server_org_
mode.py, test_org_mcp_e2e.py, test_org_session.py, ...) drives web/
server.py's ``build_app(org=...)`` directly -- a real ASGI app, sometimes a
real socket (test_mcp_daemon_contract.py's style), but always the *same
Python process* the test itself runs in, hand-assembling an ``OrgAuth``
from whatever pieces that one test cares about. None of that exercises the
one layer only a packaged, independently-running install actually goes
through: ``daemon_main.main()`` end to end -- CLI parsing, config
bootstrap, ``load_org_config()``'s fail-closed signature/mode checks,
``build_connectors()``, the instance lock, the *real* uvicorn thread bound
to a *real* socket in a *separate OS process* -- started, stopped, and
restarted the way systemd (docs/org-mode-setup-guide.md's own Step 7,
``privacyfence.service``) actually would, with a reverse proxy's Host/
X-Forwarded-* handling (the guide's Caddy config, §6) simulated at the
HTTP layer rather than assumed.

Covers, against one synthetic, Ed25519-signed ``org_config.json`` and a
real (loopback) mocked IdP (tests/integration/mock_idp.py) -- never a real
external IdP, real TLS certificate, or real reverse proxy binary:

  - **Strict startup**: a `mode: org` bundle that is malformed, unsigned, or
    missing its ``idp`` section makes the daemon refuse to start (nonzero
    exit, no listening socket) rather than silently degrading -- SEC-04/
    SEC-05's fail-closed posture, proven against the real process exit
    code, not just the ``ConfigurationError`` type.
  - **Reverse-proxy / Host handling**: a request carrying the issuer's own
    Host header (what Caddy's ``reverse_proxy`` actually sends) is served;
    an unexpected Host header is rejected -- the DNS-rebinding defense
    web/server.py's ``_HostAllowlistMiddleware`` implements, exercised over
    a real socket instead of an in-process ASGI transport.
  - **Route mounting**: org mode's own route set is reachable and local
    mode's ``/settings``/``/api/state/stream`` are not, on the real running
    service.
  - **Per-principal session creation**: a real browser ``/login`` round
    trip through the mocked IdP mints an isolated, per-principal session;
    a second principal's login neither collides with nor is disturbed by
    logging the first one out.
  - **App-level authz policy** (SEC-22, ``org_mode.AuthzPolicyConfig``,
    Phase 8): with an ``authz.allowed_domains`` allowlist configured, a
    principal the IdP already authenticated in an allowed domain signs in
    normally; one outside every allowed domain is turned away with the
    same generic sign-in failure any other rejection gets (SEC-10), no
    session issued -- ``TestAppLevelAuthzPolicy``, its own daemon since the
    policy is fixed at startup.
  - **MCP OAuth discovery**: DCR (``/register``), the authorization-code +
    PKCE dance (``/authorize`` -> mocked IdP -> ``/oauth/idp/callback``),
    ``/token``, and a real ``tools/list`` call against ``/mcp`` with the
    resulting bearer token -- and that the per-principal storage directory
    (``paths.user_dir()``) it causes to be created on disk is exactly the
    signed-in principal's own, proving the token really did resolve to
    that principal end to end, not just that the dance completed.
  - **An approval, exercised end to end, with audit-principal correctness**
    (Phase 8): ``privacyfence_propose_policy_change`` (the one
    MCP-reachable approval this module's zero-connector config can drive
    without a real Google/Slack/... credential -- the shared probe in
    ``tests/packaged_policy_probe.py``) blocks on a human
    confirmation the same way a gated tool call's own popup does; a
    *different* signed-in principal cannot decide it (cross-principal
    authorization, over the real subprocess this time -- see
    tests/unit/web/test_routes_org_approvals.py for the in-process version
    of this same check), the principal it actually belongs to can, and the
    resulting audit entry lands under that principal's own per-principal
    audit log directory, not local's or anyone else's. This is also where
    Phase 8's own grounding work found and fixed two real bugs no earlier
    org-mode test (all in-process, all effectively single-principal)
    could have caught: ``gate._run_in_popup_executor`` silently dropped
    ``contextvars`` (and therefore ``current_principal()``) across its
    thread-pool hop, so a confirmation dialog with no pre-registered
    ``PendingApproval`` (``show_rule_confirmation_popup``,
    ``show_pii_confirmation_popup``) registered under the wrong principal
    and could never be decided by anyone; and neither
    ``McpDispatcher.propose_rule_change`` nor ``.list_rules`` forced their
    principal's ``ConnectorRegistry`` entry (and the
    ``auto_accept.init_config_path()`` call that's a side effect of
    building it) to exist first, so calling either as a principal's very
    first MCP interaction raised "auto_accept config path not
    initialized." Both are fixed in ``gate.py``/``web/mcp_dispatch.py``.
  - **Clean shutdown/restart, with persisted state actually surviving it**
    (Phase 8 extends this beyond "starts cleanly again"): SIGTERM (what
    ``systemctl stop`` actually sends) brings the process down promptly,
    and a second instance started right after against the same ``$HOME``
    comes up cleanly -- the instance lock and any on-disk state left
    behind survive a stop/start cycle the way an admin running
    ``systemctl restart privacyfence`` needs them to.
    ``test_persisted_state_survives_a_restart`` proves the stronger claim:
    a principal's confirmed auto-accept rule is still on ``settings.yaml``
    and readable by the fresh process, and that principal's audit trail
    (the *same* weekly ``.jsonl`` file, its existing entries byte-for-byte
    unchanged) grows rather than resets when a post-restart MCP call
    audits again.

Deliberately NOT covered here (out of this item's own scope): a real
systemd unit, a real Caddy process, a real external IdP, or the packaged
``.deb``
specifically -- see "Why a --target install, not the .deb" below for why the
last of those isn't needed for what this test actually checks.

Also deliberately NOT covered here, and worth being explicit about after
two org-mode defects (found on the first real install, fixed in 8322c111
and cfe3716c) shipped past a fully green run of this module: *connector-
tool content* and *auto-accept rule application*, i.e. whether the tool
list ``handle_list_tools`` (``web/routes_mcp.py``) advertises over
``/mcp`` for a signed-in principal actually reflects that principal's own
connectors rather than ``LOCAL_PRINCIPAL``'s (empty, on an org server --
8322c111), and whether a rule configured in a principal's own
``settings.yaml`` is actually live in their ``AutoAcceptEvaluator`` rather
than silently ignored (cfe3716c). Both are genuinely server-side and, per
``docs/testing-policy.md``'s "What a green `org-mode-smoke` does not prove", belong at the
synthetic/unit layers rather than here -- and proving either one for real
would need a connector to actually exist in a signed-in principal's
``dispatcher.connectors``, which every connector client in this codebase
(``GmailClient``, ``SlackClient``, ...) makes a real, hardcoded external
API call to construct (``check_connection()``) with no config-driven way
to point that call at a local mock the way ``mock_idp.py`` stands in for
a real IdP -- and this codebase deliberately has no stub/no-op connector
type wired into ``build_connectors()`` to fake one, so as not to grow a
test-only code path in connector-construction, a security-sensitive area.
This module's own zero-connector synthetic config (see
``TestRunningOrgModeService``'s approval test docstring) means both
defects were, and remain, structurally invisible to a real-subprocess run
here: with no connector configured for anyone, a correctly- and an
incorrectly-scoped ``handle_list_tools`` produce byte-identical output
(``META_TOOLS`` and nothing else), and no gated tool call exists to prove
``should_auto_accept()`` against. Both are instead proven, deterministically
and in-process, exactly where they were fixed:
``tests/unit/web/test_routes_mcp.py::TestListTools::
test_org_mode_lists_the_signed_in_principals_own_connectors`` (and its
sibling ``test_org_mode_does_not_advertise_the_local_principals_
connectors``) for the tool-list scoping, and ``tests/unit/test_daemon_
main.py::TestLoadPrincipalSettings::
test_seeds_the_evaluator_so_configured_rules_actually_apply`` for the
auto-accept evaluator seeding. A green run of *this* module proves the
org-mode deployment shape (startup, Host handling, sessions, OAuth
discovery, approvals, restart survival); it was never designed to, and
still does not, prove that a signed-in principal's own connectors or
rules are correct -- see ``docs/testing-policy.md`` for that boundary
stated as policy rather than left for a reader to infer from a green
checkmark.

Why a --target install, not the .deb
-------------------------------------
``paths.data_dir()`` resolves to the repo root itself for an editable dev
checkout (see that module's own docstring) -- running ``daemon_main.main()``
that way would read/write this actual repository's own ``config/``/``org/``
directories and instance lock, not an isolated sandbox, and would collide
with any other daemon already running against this same checkout. A real
(non-editable) install is what flips ``paths._is_installed_package()`` to
True, which is what makes ``data_dir()`` resolve under ``$HOME/
.privacyfence`` instead -- and *that* is genuinely what
docs/org-mode-setup-guide.md's own Step 3 documents for a real Ubuntu
server (``pipx install privacyfence`` / ``pip install .``), not the
desktop-oriented ``.deb`` (autostart entry, app icons) scripts/
build_deb.sh produces. Building it fresh here (module-scoped, once per test
session) with ``pip install --no-deps --target <dir>`` (see the
``installed_privacyfence`` fixture's own comment for why a plain venv isn't
used instead) reuses every dependency already importable in the process
running this test and costs only the one small ``privacyfence`` package
build -- seconds, not the minutes a full PyInstaller bundle
(scripts/build_deb.sh's own job) would add.

Gating
------
Opt-in via ``PRIVACYFENCE_RUN_RELEASE_SMOKE_TESTS=1`` -- unset (the
default) skips this whole module instantly, so a contributor's ordinary
``pytest`` run never pays this module's setup cost, and neither does the
`test`/`platform-windows`/`platform-macos` full-suite jobs in tests.yml,
which never set it. Two CI jobs do: ``.github/workflows/build.yml``'s
``build-deb`` job (the release workflow TST-16's own plan-table wording
refers to) at release-tag time, and, since Phase 8 item 2,
``.github/workflows/tests.yml``'s own ``org-mode-smoke`` job on every PR --
promoted the same way ``test-windows`` -> ``platform-windows`` was by
Phase 2.1, once this module was itself proven green rather than left
release-tag-gated indefinitely.
