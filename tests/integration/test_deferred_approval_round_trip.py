"""End-to-end deferred-approval round trip (TST-09): drives the full P3
deferred protocol (gate.py's own module docstring) against a real, socket-bound
web/server.py WebServer -- the official ``mcp`` Python client for the
tool-call side, a real ``httpx`` POST against the real decide route for the
human-decision side -- rather than in-process unit coverage of each half
separately. tests/unit/test_gate.py proves gated_call's own state machine
and tests/unit/web/test_routes_approvals.py proves the decide route in
isolation, but nothing before this test proved that a human deciding
through the real HTTP approval surface actually unblocks a second,
identical MCP tool call end to end: register-or-coalesce -> hold_window
elapses ->
"approval_pending" returned to the MCP client -> POST /api/approvals/{id}/
decide -> the *next* identical call finds the decision in approvals.py's
ledger and releases without a second prompt.

Deliberately reuses test_mcp_daemon_contract.py's own real-socket-server
fixture shape (free port, wait-until-connectable, a minimal real Connector)
rather than a mocked transport -- see that module's own docstring for why
an in-process ASGI transport isn't enough to catch every real-network-stack
bug.
