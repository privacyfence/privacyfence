"""Cross-process atomicity of secure_files.atomic_write_bytes() (SEC-09).

The existing coverage of secure_files.py (tests/unit/test_secure_files.py)
proves atomic_write_bytes() writes to a sibling temp file and os.replace()s
it into place, and that the destination's permissions/content are correct
once the call returns -- but every one of those tests is single-process:
nothing in this repo's suite has ever actually raced two independent
writers against the *same* destination path the way two PrivacyFence
components genuinely can (e.g. a connector's per-tool call refreshing a
cached OAuth token file while a concurrent call for the same connector does
the same, or two just-started daemon instances losing the instance-lock
race but still briefly touching the same config file before the loser
notices). A reader between those writers' truncate-and-write steps would
see a torn (partially-old, partially-new) file if this module's
"O_CREAT|O_EXCL sibling temp file + os.replace()" design didn't actually
deliver what its own docstring promises -- this is a real OS-level
guarantee (rename is atomic on a single filesystem, per every platform this
project supports), not just an artifact of Python's GIL serializing calls
within one process, so it can only be proven by two genuinely separate OS
processes.
