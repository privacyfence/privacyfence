"""daemon_main's single-instance lock, proven against a genuinely separate
OS process (the now-removed automated-test-strategy-plan.md Phase 2.3 -- "single-
instance locking").

tests/unit/test_daemon_main.py's own TestInstanceLock already proves the
lock is OS-level, not just in-process bookkeeping
(``test_second_acquire_is_rejected_at_the_os_level_not_just_in_process``),
but does so with a second file descriptor opened by *this same process* --
which is enough to prove portalocker.lock() takes a real kernel-level lock,
but not that the lock actually survives and enforces across a process
boundary the way a second, wholly independent ``privacyfence-app`` launch
genuinely would (a different PID, its own Python interpreter, no shared
memory with the first). That's what this module adds: a real
``subprocess.Popen`` holds the lock while this test process tries (and
must fail) to acquire it, then either releases explicitly or is killed
outright -- both of which must free the lock for the next acquirer, since a
real second daemon launch after a crash needs exactly that.
