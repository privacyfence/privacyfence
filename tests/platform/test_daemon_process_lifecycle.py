"""The real daemon, started and stopped as a genuinely separate OS process
(process spawning, daemon startup, shim daemon discovery (mcp_url file), and
process cleanup on shutdown).

Every other daemon-startup test in this repo drives ``daemon_main.run_app()``
or ``main()`` as a plain Python call inside the *test's own process* (see
tests/unit/test_daemon_main.py) -- real behavior, but never across an actual
process boundary, so nothing proves the one thing every real install
depends on: that ``python -m privacyfence.daemon_main`` (what the packaged
app, a systemd unit, and mcpb/shim/src/daemon.ts's own spawn call all
eventually run) actually comes up as its own process, binds a real socket,
writes the ``mcp_url`` file the shim discovers it through (protocol.ts),
and goes away cleanly when killed -- freeing both the port and the
single-instance lock for whatever starts next. This is deliberately a small
slice of that, not the full daemon/MCP/approval/audit contract --
``tests/system/test_local_mode_system.py`` owns that larger scenario, on
all three OSes, reusing patterns from this module and from
tests/integration/test_mcp_daemon_contract.py rather than duplicating them
here.

Isolation without a real package install
-----------------------------------------
``paths.data_dir()`` resolves to the repo checkout root itself in dev/
editable-install mode (see paths.py's own docstring) -- spawning the real
entry point unmodified would read/write *this* checkout's own state.
tests/integration/test_org_ubuntu_release_smoke.py solves this with a real
``pip install --target`` into an isolated site-packages directory (needed
there since it's proving a genuine non-editable-install deployment shape);
that's real but relatively heavy machinery this module doesn't need, since
all it has to prove is that the entry point behaves correctly as a process,
not that installation itself works. Instead, the spawned process's own
bootstrap (a `-c` script, not `-m`, so it runs *before*
``privacyfence.daemon_main`` is imported) monkeypatches
``privacyfence.paths.data_dir`` directly to a fixed, already-sandboxed
directory -- the same technique every in-process test in this repo already
uses (``monkeypatch.setattr(paths, "data_dir", ...)``), just applied before
importing ``daemon_main`` rather than through pytest's fixture, since
``daemon_main.py`` binds its own ``PROJECT_ROOT = str(data_dir())`` (and the
``from .paths import data_dir`` name every function in that module then
calls) once, at import time.

An earlier version of this bootstrap instead faked ``sys.frozen``/
``sys._MEIPASS`` (the two attributes ``paths.is_bundled()`` checks) to flip
``data_dir()`` onto its real per-user-data-directory branch (``Path.home()
/ ".privacyfence"`` on POSIX, ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PrivacyFence`` on Windows --
see that function's own docstring), the same branch a genuine packaged
``.app``/installer takes. That broke real Windows CI: `pywin32`'s own
``pywintypes.py`` special-cases ``sys.frozen``
to mean "this is a real PyInstaller freeze with `pywintypes` bundled
alongside it," and raises ``ImportError: Module 'pywintypes' isn't in
frozen sys.path`` the moment anything imports it (here, transitively, via
``mcp.os.win32.utilities`` -- a real dependency of the daemon's own web
server module) in a process that set ``sys.frozen`` without actually being
a PyInstaller bundle. Patching ``paths.data_dir`` directly sidesteps that
entirely -- it never touches ``sys.frozen``, so nothing downstream
mistakes this test process for a real frozen build.
