"""The Windows autostart task definition's contract, in one place.

``installer/privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl`` is registered by
``installer/privacyfence.iss``'s ``[Code]`` section (``schtasks /create
/xml``) and is the whole of PrivacyFence's Windows autostart mechanism. It
has shipped broken more than once -- a trigger scoped to the installing
account, a missing ``version="1.2"`` that silently dropped the schema-1.2
Settings elements, a ``Principal``/``Actions`` ``id``/``Context`` pair whose
absence left the group principal bound to nothing that runs -- and every one
of those registered without complaint, so "the task exists" never caught any
of them.

Phase 13 added a further element that shipped looking like a fix but was
not one: ``<RestartOnFailure>`` reads as the Windows analogue of the macOS
LaunchAgent's ``KeepAlive``/``SuccessfulExit=false`` and the Linux
``.deb``'s systemd ``Restart=on-failure``, but a real ``windows-latest``
run killing a Scheduler-started daemon found that Task Scheduler logs a
killed action as a *successfully completed* task, so the setting never
engages for a crashed daemon at all -- it only ever answers a task that
fails to launch in the first place. Real crash-restart is the
``<TimeTrigger>``/``<Repetition>`` pair asserted below: an indefinitely
repeating trigger that relaunches the daemon on its own schedule, with the
already-running case a no-op thanks to the single-instance lock.

This module states what the definition has to say, so two very different
tests can assert the same thing about two different documents:

* ``tests/unit/test_windows_autostart_task_template.py`` checks the template
  this repo ships, on every PR, on any OS -- a regression here is caught in
  seconds instead of by a scheduled Windows-only workflow.
* ``tests/integration/test_windows_graphical_session_autostart.py`` checks
  what Task Scheduler itself stored after a real install (``schtasks /query
  /xml``), which is the document that actually governs, and which can differ
  from the template the service was handed.
