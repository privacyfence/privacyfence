"""Shared CI-diagnostics capture for system/packaged-artifact test failures.

The objective is "make test failures diagnosable entirely from cloud
CI" -- this project is developed cloud-first, with no dedicated physical
test machines to re-run a failing macOS/Windows/Linux packaged-artifact test
on by hand. Every test this covers (``pytest.mark.packaged``,
``pytest.mark.system``) already isolates its own state -- daemon home
directory, install directory, audit log -- under pytest's own per-test
``tmp_path``, so the content worth capturing already exists on disk, at a
known location, the moment a test fails. There's no separate log-forwarding
mechanism to build; only a hook (``../conftest.py``'s own
``pytest_runtest_makereport``, which calls ``capture_failure_diagnostics``
below) that runs once per failing test and:

1. writes a small ``environment.txt`` -- OS/runtime versions and the CI run
   identifier (item 1's "OS/runtime versions, and a test-run identifier"),
2. writes ``manifest.txt``, a flat recursive listing (relative path + size,
   never content) of everything under that test's own ``tmp_path`` -- covers
   item 1's "an installed-file manifest (packaged tests)" without also
   re-uploading the installed binaries themselves as CI artifacts (see
   ``capture_directory_manifest``'s own docstring for why this is a listing,
   not a copy -- a PyInstaller onedir build or an extracted ``.deb`` easily
   runs to hundreds of MB),
3. copies out the small text logs a manifest listing alone wouldn't let
   anyone actually read -- ``daemon.log``/``install*.log``/
   ``uninstall*.log`` and any ``*.jsonl`` audit log, wherever they land
   under that ``tmp_path``. Every module this phase covers already names its
   own subprocess log exactly one of these ways (e.g.
   test_windows_packaged_smoke.py's ``_running_daemon``, test_deb_packaged_
   lifecycle.py's identically-shaped helper, tests/system/
   test_local_mode_system.py's ``_prepare_sandbox``) -- nothing here
   invents a new naming convention, it just collects the ones that already
   exist.

Nothing is written on a passing run -- ``TEST_RESULTS_ROOT`` never even gets
created unless a covered test actually fails -- matching the posture
test_browser_smoke.py's own Phase 4.5 fixture already established for the
browser suite, which this module deliberately leaves untouched: its own
screenshot/DOM/console capture already satisfies this phase's "browser
console... reuse Phase 4's existing capture", so nothing here duplicates it.
