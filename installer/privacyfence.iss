; PrivacyFence Windows installer (Inno Setup 6).
;
; The now-removed docs/windows-support-plan.md Phase 4 (B4 in the now-removed docs/windows-linux-support-
; plan.md) -- the Windows analogue of build_dmg.sh's DMG: one distributable
; carrying both the daemon and the Claude Desktop extension (.mcpb), plus
; (unlike the drag-to-Applications DMG) the autostart wiring a real installer
; can do that a disk image can't -- registering/removing the Task Scheduler
; task from Phase 3.
;
; Built by scripts/build_installer.ps1, which passes every {#...} value below
; on the command line (/D...) rather than hardcoding a version or absolute
; paths here -- this file has no VERSION of its own to keep in sync, same
; "derive it from the git tag, don't hand-bump a second copy" reasoning this
; repo's CLAUDE.md gives for pyproject.toml/__init__.py.
;
; Do not run this directly with defaults -- it expects every /D on
; build_installer.ps1's iscc.exe invocation to be supplied.

; -- not a [Run] entry -- see that function's own comment and
; privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl's header comment for what actually gets
; registered and why this needs a real Task Scheduler XML task definition
; rather than a plain `schtasks /create` CLI call (short version: two
; independent CLI-flag attempts at this were each found broken by a real
; windows-graphical-session.yml run -- invalid /ri/du flags for an ONLOGON
; schedule, then a trigger that only fired for the installing account
; instead of any interactive logon -- and the capability this task
; actually needs, "run for whichever user just logged on, in their own
; session, restarting on crash," has no equivalent exposed through
; schtasks.exe's plain flags at all).
;
; Start the daemon immediately after install, same as the macOS DMG's
; LaunchAgent starting the app right after a drag-install's first login --
; without this, a user would otherwise have to log out/in before
; PrivacyFence is running at all.

; Offer to open the bundled .mcpb right after install (privacyfence/

; ships alongside the daemon rather than being downloaded separately, *and*
; which of two different install directories it landed in ({autopf} vs.
; {userpf}, depending on PrivilegesRequired=lowest's elevation outcome
; above), before they can even start looking for it in File Explorer. Its
; installed name matches the [Files] entry above, which copies {#McpbPath}
; into {app} keeping the source filename -- scripts/build_installer.ps1
; builds it as "{#AppName}-{#AppVersion}.mcpb" (ProductName-Version.mcpb),
; so that's reconstructed here rather than threaded through as its own /D
; value.
; "shellexec" (not a bare Filename/CreateProcess launch) is required: a
; .mcpb isn't something Windows can exec directly, so this needs
; ShellExecute to dispatch it to whatever's registered to open it --
; Claude Desktop, once it's installed and has claimed the extension.

[UninstallRun]

; left as a manual step (Phase 3.2). RunOnceId so this only ever runs once
; per uninstall even if Inno retries the uninstall step.

[UninstallDelete]
; Explicitly scope what uninstall does NOT touch (Phase 4.3): per-user data
; -- credentials, settings, the audit log -- lives under
; %LOCALAPPDATA%\PrivacyFence\ (paths.py's data_dir(), via its
; windows_data_dir() branch -- see that function's own docstring for why
; that's a different convention from the POSIX ~/.privacyfence dotfile
; rather than the same name reused under %USERPROFILE%), created by the app
; on first run. Uninstalling removes the program files (handled
; automatically by Inno Setup for everything under {app}) and the scheduled
; task (UninstallRun, above) only -- there is deliberately no
; [UninstallDelete] entry naming %LOCALAPPDATA%\PrivacyFence, unlike the
; entries a "clean uninstall" for a typical app might add.

[Code]
(* Copies whatever schtasks.exe wrote on stdout/stderr into Setup's own log
   file, one line per log entry.

   Everything about the autostart registration below was otherwise
   invisible: Inno logs its own [Run] entries automatically but says
   nothing at all about an Exec() call made from [Code], and Exec()
   captures neither stream. So a run of consecutive real
   windows-graphical-session.yml runs could establish only that the task
   was missing afterwards, never why -- the install log they dumped
   (tests/integration/test_windows_graphical_session_autostart.py's own
   _install_log_tail) went straight from "Installation process succeeded"
   to "Deinitializing Setup" with no trace of the registration attempt in
   between. An exit code alone would not have closed that gap either: when
   this finally ran, schtasks' own stderr was the thing that named the
   defect outright ("(1,40)::ERROR: unable to switch the encoding", the
   task XML's encoding declaration -- see privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl). *)
procedure LogSchtasksOutput(OutFile: String);
var
  Lines: TArrayOfString;
  I: Integer;
begin
  if not FileExists(OutFile) then
  begin
    Log('RegisterAutostartTask: no schtasks output file at ' + OutFile);
    Exit;
  end;
  if not LoadStringsFromFile(OutFile, Lines) then
  begin
    Log('RegisterAutostartTask: could not read schtasks output file ' + OutFile);
    Exit;
  end;
  for I := 0 to GetArrayLength(Lines) - 1 do
    Log('RegisterAutostartTask: schtasks: ' + Lines[I]);
end;

(* Registers the autostart Task Scheduler task (Phase 3.1) via a real Task
   Scheduler XML task definition (privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl, extracted to
   the temp directory by the [Files] "dontcopy" entry above), not
   schtasks.exe's plain /create flags -- see [Run]'s own comment and that
   template's own header comment for why. Substitutes the real installed
   AliasExeName path for the template's __EXEC_PATH__ placeholder, writes
   the result to a scratch file, then runs `schtasks /create /xml <file>
   /f` against it. Called from CurStepChanged(ssPostInstall) below, i.e.
   after the app's files are already in place (Files copy happens during
   ssInstall, before ssPostInstall) but before this file's own [Run]
   entries execute, so the path it substitutes in always exists by the
   time schtasks reads it.

   schtasks runs through cmd.exe rather than directly for one reason only:
   so its stdout and stderr can be redirected to a file and read back into
   the log (LogSchtasksOutput above).

   The whole body is wrapped in try/except with a Log() at each step. That
   was added while the failure was still unexplained, on the theory that an
   unhandled Pascal Script runtime exception was silently aborting Setup's
   post-install processing; the actual defect turned out to be in the task
   XML itself, and no exception was ever involved. It stays because the
   reasoning behind it holds regardless: an exception here would otherwise
   abort the rest of post-install with the overall install still reporting
   success, and nothing would say so.

   Deliberately using this parenthesis-asterisk comment style rather than
   curly braces: Pascal's curly-brace comments don't nest, and the
   {app}/{tmp}-style Inno constant references this comment needs to talk
   about would otherwise close the comment early at their own closing
   brace -- exactly the "'BEGIN' expected" compile error an earlier
   version of this comment actually hit. *)
