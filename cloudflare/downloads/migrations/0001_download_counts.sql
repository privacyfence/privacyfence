-- docs/downloads-and-release-kpi.md. Deliberately narrow: only what the public KPI
-- (installer downloads by source/version/channel/OS/architecture/day) needs, and nothing that
-- could identify a visitor -- no IP, user ID, cookie ID, fingerprint, email, Cloudflare Ray ID,
-- or User-Agent in this table, ever.
--
-- One row per (day, channel, version, platform, architecture, artifact_kind); a download
-- increments its row's counter in place (see src/counters.ts) rather than inserting one row per
-- download, so the table stays small regardless of traffic volume.
