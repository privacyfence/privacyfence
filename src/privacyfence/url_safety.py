"""Shared scheme allowlist for link targets rendered as a clickable HTML
``href``.

Used by both email_markdown.py (rich-text Gmail draft bodies) and
markdown_to_html.py (the approval window's preview pane) so a Markdown
``[text](url)`` link never turns into ``href="javascript:..."`` (or any
other scheme a mail client or browser might act on) smuggled in through
extracted, forwarded, or otherwise externally-influenced content. Both
renderers already HTML-escape literal text; this is the other half --
validating the *scheme* of an href before it's ever emitted, not just
escaping its characters.
