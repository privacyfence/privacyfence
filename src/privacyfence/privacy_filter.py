"""Category-based privacy filter: enforces the ``privacy`` / ``drive_privacy`` /
``slack_privacy`` / ``contacts_privacy`` / ``tasks_privacy`` / ``confluence_privacy`` sections
of ``settings.yaml`` (see ``resources/settings.yaml.example``).

Historically these config sections were documentation of an intended policy that no code
ever actually read -- editing a category from ``allow`` to ``block`` changed nothing. This
module is that policy, made real: connectors call ``apply_text``/``apply_list`` on a
category's data *before* it reaches ``gated_call()``, so a category set to ``block``/
``redact`` never reaches the review UI, the audit log's ``filtered_data``, or Claude --
matching ``coding-and-testing-guidelines.md`` §1.5's "the privacy filter is a floor under
human review, not a substitute for it."

Scope, deliberately narrow: only the connectors with a category schema documented in
``settings.yaml.example`` -- Gmail via the top-level ``privacy`` group, Drive via
``drive_privacy``, Slack via ``slack_privacy``, Contacts via ``contacts_privacy``, Tasks via
``tasks_privacy``, Confluence via ``confluence_privacy`` -- other connectors have no such
schema and this module invents none for them. Within those, only tools that return content
read from an external source (matching exactly which tools ``pii_detector.py`` scans -- see
its module docstring): write tools never pass through here, for the same reason they never
pass through the PII gate.

Policy values, applied per category:
  allow  -> value passed through unchanged.
  block  -> text becomes a fixed marker (``[BLOCKED BY PRIVACY FILTER]``); a list becomes
            empty. Never partial -- "block" means none of it reaches the caller.
  redact -> text becomes a length-revealing placeholder that discloses nothing about
            content (mirrors pii_detector.py's own rule: category labels may leave a
            module, matched substrings never do). List categories have no single obviously
            correct "partial" shape (unlike free text, a partially-redacted list of
            structured records -- attachments, channels, files -- has no canonical
            middle ground), so ``redact`` on a list-shaped category currently behaves
            identically to ``block``: it empties the list. Revisit if a future category
            needs finer-grained list redaction than allow/deny.

    ever writes the *current* principal's entry, so an admin editing it from
