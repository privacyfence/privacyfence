"""Org-mode download staging: an in-memory registry plus per-principal,
encrypted-at-rest disk storage for file bytes that are too large to return
inline in an MCP tool result. Mirrors approvals.py's ``PendingApprovalRegistry`` shape --
same TTL-sweep pattern, same "ephemeral state lost on daemon restart is
acceptable" posture (an interrupted download just means the human re-runs
the tool call) -- but this registry's payload is real file content, not a
decision, so it adds one more property approvals.py never needed:
plaintext must never touch this server's disk.

**Restart is not supposed to leak ciphertext.** The registry entry is
ephemeral by design, but the file it names on disk is not -- so a naive
restart would turn "lost the in-memory entry" into "orphaned the
ciphertext forever," since nothing else ever revisits a principal's
``downloads_dir()`` on its own. ``DownloadStagingStore.__init__`` closes
that gap: a fresh instance has no ``self._pending`` entries yet, so any
file already sitting in any principal's ``downloads_dir()`` at
construction time cannot correspond to one -- it is unclaimable dead
weight from a previous process life -- and gets deleted immediately,
before the first ``stage()`` call could possibly have written anything.

**Encryption at rest.** ``stage()`` generates a fresh 256-bit ``token``
(``secrets.token_bytes(32)``) and returns it to the caller -- that return
value is the *only* copy of the token that ever exists. The registry keys
itself and the on-disk ciphertext filename by ``lookup_id =
sha256(token)``, and derives the AES-256-GCM key via HKDF-SHA256 from the
token itself. Neither the token nor the derived key is ever written to
disk, logged, or kept anywhere in this process after ``stage()`` returns
except inside the caller's own return value (which flows into a tool-call
result and, from there, into the human's one-time download URL). A
snapshot of this server's disk, a backup, or a forensic recovery of a
"deleted" file therefore all yield AES-GCM ciphertext, never plaintext --
with one explicit caveat: a live compromise
of this daemon process itself, which necessarily holds plaintext briefly
around encrypt/decrypt, same as any encryption-at-rest scheme.

``claim()`` is single-use: a successful claim deletes both the ciphertext
file and the registry entry before returning, so nothing meant to be
downloaded once still exists on the server afterward. There is
deliberately no oracle distinguishing "wrong token" from "expired token"
from "already claimed" -- all three return ``None``.
