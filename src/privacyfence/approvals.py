"""Deferred-approval registry: the domain object P3 adds on top of gate.py's
existing decision loop.

Principal dimension (P9, not P6/P7/P8): ``approval_ui.py``'s own module
docstring already promised this -- "``WebApprovalUI`` stays a true
singleton deliberately ... in org mode one instance still serves every
principal (its ``PendingApprovalRegistry`` gains the principal dimension
internally instead)" -- but nothing actually needed it until now, since
``/approvals`` was never mounted in org mode through P8 (web/server.py's
own module docstring). web/routes_org_approvals.py (P9) is what finally
reaches this registry from more than one principal at once, so every
``PendingApproval`` now stamps ``principal_id`` at registration time (from
``current_principal()`` -- the same contextvar pattern every other
per-principal registry in this codebase already uses, so gate.py's own
call sites into ``register_or_coalesce``/``register_confirm`` need no
signature change), and every read/write method below takes an optional
``principal_id`` to filter or authorize against. ``None`` (the default
everywhere) means "no filter" -- gate.py's own internal calls, and every
pre-P9 caller/test, keep seeing every approval regardless of principal,
which is also exactly correct for local mode's single implicit principal.
web/routes_org_approvals.py is the one real caller that ever passes a real
``principal_id``, and it does so on every method it calls (§10.5: "every
approval, card, preview, decision ... read is authorized against
current_principal()").

The coalescing/ledger key also gained a principal dimension for the same
reason web/mcp_dispatch.py's retry-dedupe cache did at P7: ``(connector,
tool, canonical(args))`` alone collides across two principals who happen to
call the same tool with the same arguments, which P7's own fix note
already named as exactly this codebase's recurring failure mode once a
second principal
becomes real. ``_by_key`` is keyed on ``(principal_id, dedupe_key)`` here
for the same reason.

Two kinds of caller reach this module:

- gate.py, for the *main* gate decision of a review/popup-gated call -- see
  ``register_or_coalesce``/``consume_ledger``/``finalize``/``wait_async``,
  which together implement the deferred protocol: register a pending
  approval, wait up to ``hold_window`` seconds, and if nobody decided in
  time, let the caller return a structured "approval_pending" result instead
  of blocking further. A later, identical call finds the decision via
  ``consume_ledger`` and releases without a second prompt.
- web_approval_ui.py, for *every* card and confirmation dialog it shows
  (whether or not it's the "main" decision for some gated call) -- see
  ``register_confirm``/``answer``/``get``/``list_pending``, which is the
  multi-item store P1's own module docstring already named as this module's
  future job ("``current()`` below is a single slot, not a registry... it
  becomes a real per-principal registry (approvals.py) in P3").

One registry instance backs both uses (``WebApprovalUI.deferred_registry``),
so a card gate.py is waiting on and a card a human is looking at in the
browser are always the same object.

Two decision layers, not one, because a single gated call can involve more
than one human interaction (the main popup, then possibly a PII
"are you sure?" confirmation, then possibly an "Always allow" rule
confirmation -- see gate.py's own module docstring):

- ``answer()`` resolves one *UI step* -- whatever card or confirmation is
  currently on screen. It never touches the ledger; it only wakes up
  whichever thread is blocked showing that one dialog (WebApprovalUI's
  ``show_popup``/``show_read_popup``/the two confirmation methods, exactly
  as blocking as they were pre-P3 -- see that module).
- ``finalize()`` resolves the *whole approval* -- the outcome gate.py's own
  interaction driver arrives at after however many UI steps it took. Only
  finalize() writes the decision ledger (keyed by
  ``(connector, tool, canonical(args))``, single-use for writes per D3) and
  wakes ``wait_async()`` -- the thing gate.py's hold window actually awaits.

Both events are ``threading.Event`` rather than ``asyncio.Event``: this
registry is touched from the asyncio event loop (gate.py, the web routes'
request handlers) *and* from plain OS threads (WebApprovalUI's blocking
calls run on gate.py's ``_popup_executor``; a rules-changed broadcast can
fire from any thread that called ``auto_accept.reload_rules()``, e.g. the
AppKit main thread). ``threading.Event`` is safe to set/wait from any of
them; ``wait_async()`` bridges back into the event loop via
``asyncio.to_thread`` for the one caller (gate.py) that needs a non-blocking
await.
