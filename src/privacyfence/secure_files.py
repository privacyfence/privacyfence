"""Shared atomic-write and permission helpers for credential/config storage
(SEC-09).

Before this module existed, every credential/token/config writer in this
codebase followed the same pattern: truncate-and-write the destination file
directly, then ``chmod`` it to ``0600`` *after* the write completed -- a
reader (or a crash, or a concurrent daemon instance) between those two steps
could observe a partially-written file at whatever permissions the process
umask left it with, and a failed ``chmod`` was silently swallowed at
``debug`` level rather than surfaced. The directories holding these files
(``~/.privacyfence`` and its subdirectories) were created with the process's
default umask rather than deliberately restricted, too -- see
``docs/security-and-compliance.md``'s "Storage format and permissions"
section for the threat this closes.

``atomic_write_text``/``atomic_write_json`` fix the file-write half: the
real content is written to a freshly ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL``-created sibling temp
file (in the same directory, so the final ``os.replace`` is atomic -- a
rename across filesystems isn't) with the destination's final permissions
from the instant the file exists, then swapped into place. A reader can only
ever see the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial
one. ``secure_mkdir`` fixes the directory half: it creates -- or re-tightens
-- a directory to ``0700`` rather than trusting the umask, including for a
directory that already existed (e.g. one created by a pre-SEC-09 install).

A permissions failure that used to be logged at ``debug`` (effectively
invisible) is now a ``warning`` in both helpers below, per SEC-09.

The final ``os.replace`` itself gets a short Windows-only retry (see
``_replace_with_retries``): unlike POSIX ``rename``, Windows' replace can
transiently fail with ``PermissionError`` (``WinError 5``) when the
destination is momentarily held open by another process -- exactly the
"two just-started daemon instances racing to touch the same config file"
scenario this module exists to make safe, plus routine AV/indexer scans of
a freshly-created file. ``tests/platform/test_atomic_write_concurrency.py``
exercises this with two genuinely separate OS processes.

    own permissions to ``mode``.

    Unlike ``Path.mkdir(mode=...)``, this is applied even when ``path``
    already existed -- e.g. a directory created by a pre-SEC-09 install
    under the process's default umask -- and isn't itself subject to
    umask. Parent directories created along the way (``parents=True``)
    keep whatever the umask leaves them with; only the leaf directory this
    call names is treated as a security boundary, since that's the one
    callers actually store sensitive files directly under.

    A ``chmod`` failure (e.g. a filesystem that doesn't support POSIX
    permissions) is logged at ``warning`` and otherwise non-fatal -- the
    directory is still created and usable, just not provably restricted.

    ``foreign_owner_ok`` is for the directories #428 Phase 4's privilege
    separation deliberately shares between two accounts (``paths.py``'s
    ``data_dir()`` and ``handoff_dir()`` on a separated install): there, a
    process running as the logged-in user resolves a directory *owned by the
    daemon's service account*, and ``chmod`` on it is guaranteed to fail with
    ``EPERM`` every single time. Skipping the attempt when this process isn't
    the owner keeps that from becoming a warning on every path resolution --
    which would train a reader to ignore exactly the warnings SEC-09 added
    this logging for. The owner's own process still re-asserts the mode, so
    the self-healing property is unchanged; and the separated layout gets a
    check of its own regardless, in ``privilege_separation.audit_layout()``.
    On Windows it skips the attempt outright, for the related-but-distinct
    reason ``_is_owned_by_this_process()`` gives: there is no mode there for
    the ``chmod`` to assert in the first place.
