"""Ed25519 signing/verification for organization config bundles
(org_config.json), plus the plain-hash helper daemon_main.py's startup
logging uses. ADR 0016 records why integrity has these two layers.

Threat model this closes: org_config.json carries the org's IdP client
secret, the Google/Slack/Salesforce/Atlassian app registrations, and (in
org mode) this daemon's own OAuth 2.1 authorization-server trust
configuration (``idp.issuer``, ``server.issuer_url``). Before this,
anything that can write to this file -- a compromised backup, a
misconfigured file share the bundle is distributed over, brief physical/
admin access to the machine -- could silently redirect this daemon's
whole trust root, and a tampered-but-still-valid-JSON replacement was
indistinguishable from the real thing (refusing a malformed org-mode
config at startup only catches malformed/unreadable files, not a
well-formed-but-hostile one).

Design -- trust-on-first-use (TOFU), the same model SSH host keys use:
each organization generates an Ed25519 keypair once
(``scripts/build_org_bundle.py --generate-signing-key``) and signs every
bundle it builds with it (``--sign-key``). The *first* signed bundle an
install ever sees has its embedded public key trusted on that basis
alone and pinned to disk (``pinned_public_key_path()``); every bundle
after that -- installed via PrivacyFence Settings' "Install/Update
Organization Config..." (``settings_controller.install_org_config_
bytes``) or dropped onto disk by hand and picked up at the next daemon
start (``daemon_main.load_org_config``) -- must verify against that
pinned key or is rejected outright. That closes the obvious downgrade
this would otherwise still allow (an attacker replacing a signed bundle
with an unsigned or self-signed one) without requiring any out-of-band
key distribution beyond the bundle itself.

An install that never adopts signing (no ``--sign-key`` ever used) never
pins a key and keeps working exactly as before -- signing is opt-in for
local mode. It's mandatory for ``mode: org`` (see ``daemon_main.
load_org_config``'s and ``settings_controller.install_org_config_bytes``'s
own enforcement of that), since org mode is the surface this phase is
hardening towards enterprise-production readiness, not every existing
local install.

This module intentionally takes each caller's own ``org_dir`` as a
parameter rather than importing ``paths.org_dir`` itself -- both
``daemon_main.py`` and ``settings_controller.py`` already import ``org_dir``
into their own module namespace and their tests monkeypatch it there
(see e.g. ``test_daemon_main.py``'s ``monkeypatch.setattr(daemon_main,
"org_dir", ...)``); importing a second, independent reference to
``paths.org_dir`` here would silently bypass that and point the pinned-
key file at a different (real) location during tests.

Ed25519 (``cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519``) rather
than RSA: fixed-size 32-byte keys/64-byte signatures make embedding both
directly in the JSON bundle (base64) simple, and it's the same
"security-critical, spec-governed, don't hand-roll it" primitive class
``pyproject.toml``'s own dependency comments already invoke for JWT/
WebAuthn verification elsewhere in this codebase -- ``cryptography`` is
already a runtime dependency there, so this adds nothing new to what's
installed.

``scripts/build_org_bundle.py`` does NOT import this module (see its own
module docstring: it's meant to be runnable standalone, without a
PrivacyFence install) -- it re-implements the same canonicalization/
signing logic against ``cryptography`` directly. The two MUST stay
byte-for-byte identical or a bundle signed by the script will fail to
verify here; ``_canonical_payload_bytes`` below is deliberately simple
(sorted-key compact JSON) to make that easy to keep in sync.
