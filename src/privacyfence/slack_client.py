"""Slack API client.

Uses a single Slack user token (``xoxp-...``) so the connector sees exactly
what the authenticated user sees — all channels, DMs, and private groups they
are a member of — without requiring a bot to be invited anywhere.

The token is obtained via Slack's OAuth v2 browser flow (see
``authorize_interactive`` below), driven from PrivacyFence Settings. The
Slack app itself (client id/secret) is organization-level config installed via
the "Install/Update Organization Config…" action in PrivacyFence Settings — a user only ever
sees a browser consent screen, never a token to copy/paste.

Required user token scopes (see ``DEFAULT_USER_SCOPES``):
  - ``channels:read`` / ``groups:read`` / ``im:read`` / ``mpim:read``
  - ``channels:history`` / ``groups:history`` / ``im:history`` / ``mpim:history``
  - ``users:read`` / ``users:read.email``
  - ``search:read``
  - ``chat:write``
  - ``im:write`` / ``channels:write`` / ``groups:write`` / ``mpim:write`` (mark_unread /
    conversations.mark, and opening new conversations via ``open_conversation`` -- the needed
    scope depends on channel type: ``im:write`` for a 1:1 DM, ``mpim:write`` for a group DM)

``SlackClient`` optionally persists two whole-workspace directory snapshots to disk --
``user_cache_file`` (id -> name/email/is_bot) and ``channel_cache_file`` (id -> name/is_mpim, across
public/private channels, DMs, and group DMs). When given, ``get_user_info``/``resolve_channel_name``/
``resolve_is_group_dm`` check these first, refreshing them from Slack (``users.list``/
``conversations.list``) automatically about once a week, instead of falling back to a live per-id
call for every unique message author/channel a search or history fetch turns up. Both default to ""
(disabled) -- resolution then behaves exactly as it did before this existed. See
``refresh_user_directory``/``refresh_channel_directory`` for the explicit, immediate re-sync the
``slack_refresh_user_cache``/``slack_refresh_channel_cache`` bridge tools use.
