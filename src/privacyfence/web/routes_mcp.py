"""The Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint -- what took over the original
``privacyfence-bridge``'s four jobs (find/launch the daemon, fetch the
manifest, register one MCP tool per ``ToolSpec``, forward calls) for a
client that talks to PrivacyFence directly, no intermediate process
required. The bridge itself was retired at P5, once this transport had
shipped a stable release.

P2 scope only: this is a hosting change for the *transport*, not the
approval protocol. A gated call reaching a connector here still blocks on
whichever ``ApprovalUI`` ``approval_ui.init_approval_ui()`` currently
resolves to (the web approval UI, unconditionally since P10 -- through P9
this could also be the native one, selected by ``web.approval_ui``, a
config key P10 removed along with the native implementation itself),
exactly like a call arriving over the bridge's IPC socket used to before P5
retired it. Deferred approvals, concurrent pending approvals, and
``privacyfence_await_approval`` are P3's ``_popup_lock`` retirement, not
this module's ("P2 before P3" is deliberate: the deferred protocol is
written once, on the transport it ships on, instead of being added to the
bridge/IPC protocol first and thrown away one phase later).

Built on the official MCP Python SDK's low-level ``Server`` (dynamic tool
registration -- the tool set depends on which connectors are currently
built, so it can't be the decorator-per-tool ``FastMCP`` surface) plus
``StreamableHTTPSessionManager`` (D2/D10).

    Streamable HTTP requires the request that opens a session to be
    ``initialize``. When a client opens with anything else, the SDK's session
    manager still admits a session -- it allocates the id before it has parsed
    the body far enough to know better -- answers 400, and discards that
    session again (``_serve_opening_request``'s own
    ``established = status < 400``). All correct, except that the 400 goes out
    carrying the discarded session's id anyway:
    ``StreamableHTTPServerTransport._create_error_response`` stamps
    ``self.mcp_session_id`` on every error it builds, and by then the
    transport has one.

    That id is dead on arrival and a client has no way to know it. The
    official client transport reads the header off *every* response before it
    checks whether the response succeeded, adopts it, and stamps it on
    everything it sends next -- all of which this daemon then answers,
    ``initialize`` very much included, with 404 "Session not found". One
    rejected frame becomes a connection that can never recover, for as long as
    the client process lives.

    ``mcpb/shim/src/sessionFetch.ts`` defends the bundled shim against the
    same cascade from the client side, which is what reaches a user whose
    daemon is older than this. This is the other half of it: a client pointed
    straight at ``/mcp`` -- a documented setup, ``claude mcp add --transport
    http privacyfence ...``, with no shim anywhere in it -- is protected here
    or not at all.

    A session id is only ever meaningful on a response that established or
    used a session; on a failure it names, at best, something already gone.
    Successful responses pass through untouched, so ordinary session handling
    -- including the ``initialize`` response that legitimately carries a brand
    new id -- is unaffected.
