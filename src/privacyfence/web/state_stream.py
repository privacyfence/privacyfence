"""SSE state-push channel: ``GET /api/state/stream``, one connection per
open tab, carrying two
independently-updating event types --

- ``event: settings`` -- ``SettingsController.snapshot()``, pushed the
  moment something changes it out from under an open page: a rule edited
  over MCP, an OAuth flow finishing on its own background thread, a grant's
  resource name resolving. Without this channel a browser tab showing
  ``/settings`` would need a manual refresh for every one of those, and the
  snapshot a mutating POST returns is a promise the page can't otherwise
  keep -- see settings_controller.py's own docstring on ``on_change``.
- ``event: approvals`` -- ``approvals.PendingApprovalRegistry.list_pending()``
  summaries, polled the same way ``web/routes_approvals.py``'s own
  ``/api/approvals/stream`` already does. The registry can hold several
  of these at once; carrying them on this shared channel too means the
  approvals page's own SSE
  subscription (routes_approvals.py, unchanged) and this settings-shaped
  one agree on the same underlying data without either needing to know
  about the other.

Every open page re-renders from a *full* state dict, never a patch --
``window.__pfRender(state)``/``window.__pfRenderApprovals(state)`` are both
idempotent full re-renders (settings_window_html.py's/the approval list's
own convention) -- so there is no ordering or patch-application problem to
solve here, only "deliver the latest snapshot, promptly, to every open
connection", including on first connect/reconnect (a reconnect delivers
full state rather than a patch).

This module also owns the one piece of plumbing settings_controller.py's
``call_on_main`` dispatcher seam needs once a web server is
actually running: ``set_loop``/``call_soon_threadsafe`` marshal a
background-thread callback (an OAuth flow finishing, a rules-changed
broadcast) onto this stream's own asyncio event loop, so the subscriber
queues are only ever touched from that one loop.
