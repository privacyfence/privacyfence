"""Connector-call dispatch for the ``/mcp`` endpoint -- dedupe/staleness
logic, the meta-tools (check_policy/list_rules/propose_rule_change/
begin-end-unattended-session), and manifest building, all scoped to one
Streamable HTTP session.

Originally written (P2) as a self-contained Python port of what was then
``bridge/src/tools.ts``'s schema mapping and ``ipc_server.IPCServer``'s own
``_call_connector``/``_check_policy``/``_list_rules``/
``_propose_rule_change``/``_build_manifest``/begin-end-unattended-session --
deliberately not a shared refactor of ``IPCServer`` at the time, so as not
to put that module's own already-green test suite at risk mid-migration.
P5 deleted the bridge and ``ipc_server.py`` entirely once both had a stable
release behind them, so
this module (alongside its P3 collaborator, ``approvals.py``) is now simply
the one connector-call dispatcher there is, not "the /mcp counterpart" of
anything else. The session key this dispatch is scoped to is a fresh UUID
per Streamable HTTP session (routes_mcp.py, via the low-level Server's own
per-session lifespan) -- the same role ``id(writer)`` played for a bridge
connection.
