"""``GET /downloads/{token}`` -- the browser-facing half of org-mode
download staging. A staged download's token (download_staging.DownloadStagingStore.stage's
return value, base64url-encoded into the URL) is a one-time bearer
credential for a single file: whoever holds the link and is currently
signed in as the principal it was staged for can claim it exactly once.

Auth: reuses ``org_session.authenticated`` exactly as every other org-mode
browser route does -- no new auth mechanism. The 401/redirect-to-/login
branch mirrors routes_connect.py's own pattern for a browser-navigated GET
(session cookie missing or expired sends the human to sign in, not a bare
401 JSON body, since this route is always reached by a human clicking or
pasting a link into their own browser tab, never by a JS fetch), with
``next`` set to this same link so the sign-in returns to it.

``{token}`` in the URL is the raw 256-bit token, not the store's internal
``lookup_id`` -- see download_staging.py's own module docstring for why
the two are different values and why only the token, never the
``lookup_id`` alone, can decrypt anything.
