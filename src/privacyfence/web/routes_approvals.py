"""The web approval surface: WebApprovalUI (web_approval_ui.py) registers a
pending card or confirmation, and these routes are what let a human actually
see and decide it from a browser instead of a native dialog.

P3: ``GET /approvals`` lists every currently-unanswered card/confirmation
(approvals.PendingApprovalRegistry.list_pending()), not just one -- several
can genuinely be pending at once now that gate.py's ``_popup_lock`` is gone,
each independently decidable from its own ``/approvals/{id}`` link. ``GET
/api/approvals/stream`` is the SSE counterpart so the list page (or
whatever's showing it) updates live as approvals appear and get decided,
without polling.

The one JS change to approval_window_html.py's/dialog_window_html.py's
otherwise-untouched documents: a small shim script, injected here rather
than editing either module, defines ``window.webkit.messageHandlers.pf.
postMessage`` as a ``fetch()`` POST to this module's own decide endpoint --
the two shipped documents never need to know whether they're running in a
WKWebView or a browser tab.
