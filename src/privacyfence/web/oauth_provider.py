"""``OrgOAuthProvider`` -- PrivacyFence's own minimal OAuth 2.1 authorization
server (P7), implementing the official MCP SDK's ``OAuthAuthorizationServerProvider``
protocol. Wired into web/routes_mcp.py's ``/mcp`` (via ``verify_token``,
satisfying the SDK's separate ``TokenVerifier`` protocol too) and into
``mcp.server.auth.routes.create_auth_routes`` (which builds ``/authorize``,
``/token``, ``/register``, ``/revoke`` and the AS metadata document against
whatever provider it's given -- see that module's own docstring for why
none of that protocol machinery needed hand-rolling, same reasoning as D2).

The diagram in ``OAuthAuthorizationServerProvider.authorize``'s own
docstring is exactly this class's shape:

    Client (Claude) --> PrivacyFence (this AS) --> the org's IdP (OIDC)

``authorize()`` doesn't decide anything itself -- it redirects the browser
to the org IdP (org_identity.py), stashing the *original* client's request
under a fresh state value of PrivacyFence's own. ``handle_idp_callback()``
(called by web/routes_mcp.py's own IdP-facing route, not part of the SDK's
protocol) is where the IdP's answer comes back: it verifies the ID token,
resolves a ``Principal`` (org_identity.principal_from_claims -- the exact
same function web/routes_org_identity.py's browser login uses, which is
what makes "the browser session and the MCP token are then provably
the same identity" true by construction), and only then mints
PrivacyFence's *own* authorization code, bound to that principal, and
redirects the browser on to the original client's own redirect_uri.

Storage: registered OAuth clients (DCR) are persisted to disk
(``org_dir()/oauth_clients.json``) -- losing that on restart would mean
every installed Claude connector has to re-register, which is real user
friction DCR is supposed to spare people. Pending authorizations,
authorization codes and access tokens are in-memory only -- short-lived by
design (§5.4's decision-ledger precedent: state that's supposed to expire
soon anyway doesn't need to survive a restart), so losing them on restart
just means signing in again, not a security gap.

Refresh tokens are the one exception (#402), and only since
``sealed_refresh_store.py`` existed to hold them in a shape worth having:
they are persisted to ``org_dir()/oauth_refresh.json``, each record sealed
under a key derived from the token itself rather than one this daemon keeps.
"Just sign in again" is a fair price for a human at a browser, but a
*scheduled* tool call has nobody present to complete an IdP redirect, so
losing the refresh chain turned a restart into an outage for exactly the
callers that cannot recover on their own. See that module's docstring for
why sealing to the bearer is not the same trade as encrypting at rest under
a daemon-held key, and for what is deliberately left in the clear.

Resource controls (SEC-16): ``/register`` is unauthenticated by design -- that's what "dynamic"
means in DCR -- so this class, not the reverse proxy in front of it, is
the only thing standing between an anonymous POST loop and an unbounded
``oauth_clients.json``. ``register_client`` enforces a total-client cap
and a per-registration metadata-size cap (both raise ``RegistrationError``,
surfaced by the SDK's handler as RFC 7591's ``invalid_client_metadata``),
and opportunistically prunes clients nobody has authenticated as in
``_STALE_CLIENT_TTL_SECONDS`` before checking the cap. ``authorize()``
count-bounds ``_pending`` (not just TTL-expires it) so a burst of
authorize attempts can't grow that dict without limit inside one TTL
window. None of this replaces reverse-proxy rate-limiting in front of
``/register``/``/authorize``/``/token`` (see the org setup guide's own
section on it) -- it's the in-process backstop for whatever gets through.
