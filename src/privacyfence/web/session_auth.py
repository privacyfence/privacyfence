"""Shared local-mode session/CSRF/bootstrap helpers for every route in the
combined web app -- "/approvals and /settings are one application: one
header, one nav, one palette, one session, links both ways" -- factored
out of web/routes_approvals.py,
which owned this logic alone before web/routes_settings.py needed the exact
same posture on a second set of routes sharing the same session and the
same ``pf_session`` cookie.

**SEC-06.** Through
v4.0.0a12 this module's whole model was "the cookie's own value is the one
shared secret everyone in the install has" -- the persistent, never-
rotated ``web_token`` itself, carried in the ``?token=`` query string the
daemon logged on every startup and reused, unchanged, across restarts
forever. That meant a token that leaked once (a log file, shell history, a
shared screen) stayed valid until someone manually deleted the token file
and restarted the daemon: no expiry, no single-use exchange, no way to
revoke just that one exposure.

This module now splits that one secret into two purpose-built pieces,
mirroring web/org_session.py's own real-session model (minus the
per-principal identity org mode needs and local mode doesn't):

- ``BootstrapStore`` mints short-lived, single-use codes -- the only thing
  ever carried in a URL (``?bootstrap=<code>``) or written to a log line
  (see daemon_main.py's own startup logging and web/server.py's
  ``_BootstrapMiddleware``). A code is consumed -- deleted -- the instant
  it's checked, valid or not, so it is exactly one attempt at establishing
  a session, never a standing credential.
- ``LocalSessionStore`` holds the real, server-side sessions a bootstrap
  exchange mints: an independent random id, a sliding idle timeout, and a
  hard absolute timeout from creation regardless of activity -- the
  "cookie with idle + absolute expiry" SEC-06 asks for. Nothing about a
  session id is ever derived from, or comparable to, the long-lived local
  secret (``web/server.py``'s ``load_or_create_token()``) any more; that
  secret's only remaining job is authorizing ``POST /api/bootstrap`` (see
  server.py) to mint a fresh bootstrap code on demand, via an
  ``Authorization`` header, never a query string -- so a human who still
  has filesystem access to this machine (the same trust boundary this
  secret has always drawn) can get back in without restarting the daemon
  once a session has expired, but nothing about that recovery path ever
  touches a URL, browser history, or a log file again either.

    idle-/absolute-timed out, reopened by something like a browser
    restoring a previously-open tab verbatim rather than a fresh click on a
    freshly-logged link.

    This used to point readers at ``privacyfence.log`` for "the newest
    sign-in link PrivacyFence logged" -- advice that never worked and never
    will: daemon_main.py's startup log line embeds the link, but every
    logger in the process is wrapped in SecretRedactingFormatter (SEC-10),
    whose key=value pattern matches the literal word ``bootstrap`` and
    scrubs the code to ``bootstrap=[REDACTED]`` before the line ever
    reaches a file or a terminal -- restarting PrivacyFence changed nothing
    about that, since the fresh line from the new process is redacted the
    same way. The three things that actually work, in the order most
    readers can actually use them: asking a connected MCP client (e.g.
    Claude -- installed alongside PrivacyFence per README.md's Quick start,
    so this is available even on a first run, before Settings has ever been
    opened) to call ``privacyfence_get_sign_in_link`` (web/mcp_tools.py),
    which mints one and hands it straight back in the conversation -- no
    terminal at all -- is also the one this page now leads with (issue
    #423's proposed-fix part 3): P10 removed the menu bar, so "ask Claude"
    is the intended recovery path on a headless install, not a fallback
    buried under the "why you're here" line; the discovery file
    ``web/server.py``'s
    ``mint_bootstrap_url()`` writes outside the logging pipeline every time
    PrivacyFence (re)starts, for a reader who'd rather grab it themselves;
    and minting a fresh code on demand via ``POST /api/bootstrap`` without
    restarting anything, for a reader with neither -- this page spells out
    the actual command for that last one rather than just naming the
    endpoint, since a reader who's landed here from a dead link and has no
    MCP client connected yet is exactly the audience that finding this
    self-explanatory matters most for. ``request`` supplies only this
    page's own origin (scheme+host+port), the same one the reader is
    already looking at, so the command below can be pasted as-is.

    The discovery-file path and the shell command are both platform-
    dependent -- ``paths.data_dir()`` resolves to the real, live directory
    this install actually writes ``approvals_url``/``web_token`` into
    (``~/.privacyfence`` on POSIX, ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PrivacyFence`` on
