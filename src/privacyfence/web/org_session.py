"""Org-mode browser sessions (P7): the session cookie is Secure, HttpOnly,
SameSite=Lax, with a short idle timeout. A server-side session store mapping an opaque, unguessable
session id to the ``Principal`` that authenticated it via web/routes_org_
identity.py's ``/login`` -- deliberately not the local-mode ``session_
auth.py`` model of "the cookie's own value is the one shared secret
everyone in the install has": org mode has more than one user, so each
session has to carry its own, distinct identity.

As of P9 this backs a real, principal-scoped ``/approvals``/``/security``
surface for org mode -- web/routes_approvals.py's ``build_routes()``, not
that same module's local-mode ``create_app()``, which still authenticates
with one shared secret and has no principal filtering (see that module's
own docstring for why the shared-secret surface was never mounted under
org mode as-is). ``/settings``
(routes_settings.py's ~30-action surface) is the one still not wired into
this session model -- still local-mode-only for now, a documented
follow-up (see web/server.py's own module docstring's "Still deliberately
not mounted in org mode" section). What this module and routes_org_
identity.py deliver is the session mechanism itself, real and tested end
to end, plus web/server.py's ``_PrincipalScopeMiddleware`` resolving
``current_principal()`` from it (P6's own seam) -- so any route built
against it from here on gets per-principal scoping for free, exactly as
web/routes_approvals.py's org-mode routes already do.
