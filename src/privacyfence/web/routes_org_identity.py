"""Browser login for org mode -- PrivacyFence acting as its own OIDC relying party against the
org's IdP, for a human visiting the web approval/settings surface
directly. This is a *separate* IdP-facing redirect_uri from web/
oauth_provider.py's ``OrgOAuthProvider`` (which does the same IdP dance,
against the same IdP registration, but on Claude's behalf as part of
PrivacyFence's own OAuth 2.1 authorization-server role) -- both go through
org_identity.py's identical claims-to-Principal mapping (see that module's
own docstring on why that sharing matters), but they're two distinct flows
with two distinct redirect URIs an org admin registers once with the IdP:

- ``/oauth/idp/login-callback`` -- this module, a browser's own sign-in.
- ``/oauth/idp/callback`` -- web/oauth_provider.py, on behalf of a pending
  Claude/MCP-client authorization.

Not wired into routes_approvals.py's or routes_settings.py's own auth
checks in this phase -- see org_session.py's module docstring for what
that means and doesn't mean.
