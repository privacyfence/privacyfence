"""Tool manifest translation for the ``/mcp`` endpoint (routes_mcp.py).

Ports bridge/src/tools.ts's schema mapping (``paramSchema``/
``buildInputShape``/``UNIFORM_READ_ONLY_ANNOTATIONS``/``toCallToolResult``)
from zod/TypeScript into JSON Schema/Python -- a translation of an existing,
shipped mapping, not a redesign.
``ToolSpec.to_dict()`` (connector.py) stays the single source of truth for
what a tool *is*; this module only decides how that shape is presented to an
MCP client.

Also carries PrivacyFence's own meta-tools (privacyfence_check_policy and
friends) -- not sourced from any connector's manifest, ported field-for-field
from bridge/src/tools.ts's ``registerMetaTools`` (same names, same
descriptions, same input shapes) since routes_mcp.py replaces the bridge as
the thing serving them, not what they are (§8.1: "the other three move into
web/routes_mcp.py against the connector registry directly"). One exception:
``GET_SIGN_IN_LINK_TOOL`` has no bridge-era counterpart -- it's new, added
once P10 (web/server.py's own module docstring) had left local mode's web
UI headless with no menu bar link of its own to fall back on.

# explicitly). The real authorization is gate.py's gate -- auto/review/popup,
# auto-accept rules, the audit log -- enforced here in the daemon itself, not
# in the calling client. Advertising every tool uniformly as read-only/
# non-destructive keeps the client from throwing its own redundant
