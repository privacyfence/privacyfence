"""Shared Telegram phone/code/2FA sign-in coroutines, used by both the
desktop settings UI and org mode's per-user ``/connect`` page.

Extracted from settings_controller.py's telegram_start_auth/telegram_
submit_code/telegram_submit_2fa work() closures -- same telethon calls,
same short-lived connect/disconnect-per-step pattern (no long-lived
connection held across requests, since a browser round trip can be
arbitrarily far apart from the next one; see settings_controller.py's own
comment on this). Local mode calls these via ``asyncio.run()`` inside a
background thread (``_run_async``, unchanged); org mode's web/routes_
connect.py awaits them directly on the ASGI event loop its own route
handlers already run on -- there is no browser-loopback/redirect-URI
concept here at all (MTProto has no equivalent), so unlike Google/Slack/
Salesforce/Atlassian this is the *same* flow in both modes, just driven
from two different callers.
