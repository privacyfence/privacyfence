"""Checks GitHub Releases for a newer PrivacyFence version, once a day.

PrivacyFence ships as a single DMG (app + `.mcpb` shim, one version number) via GitHub Releases tagged
``v<major>.<minor>.<patch>[<stage><n>]`` — no PyPI package exists to check against instead.
``stage`` is one of ``a``/``b``/``rc`` (PEP 440's short pre-release spellings; this is also the
exact scheme `__version__` itself now uses, derived from these same tags by setuptools_scm — see
this repo's CLAUDE.md "Releasing" section and src/privacyfence/__init__.py); a bare
``v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`` tag is a stable release. The beta channel isn't hypothetical: it's the
channel `website/download/download.js` reads to populate the "Want to test the next version?"
section, and by now well over a dozen pre-release tags have been cut against it (``v4.0.0a11``,
``v4.0.0a12``, ``v4.0.0a14``, the earlier ``v3.2.0-beta``, ``v3.3.0-beta1``/``2`` and
``v3.4.0-beta1``/``2``/``3``, plus a run of now-inert ``v4.0.0-alphaN`` tags — see the next
paragraph). ``_STAGE_RANK`` below is the contract those tags rank against.

Note the two spellings are not equivalent: the early ``v4.0.0-alpha1`` through ``-alpha10``
(and the ``-apha2`` typo) tags deliberately don't match `_VERSION_RE`'s short PEP 440 form, so
`parse_version()` returns ``None`` for them and they're inert for ranking purposes — only the
``a11``/``a12``/``a14``-style short-form tags participate.

Between release tags, `__version__` is one setuptools_scm synthesizes itself rather than one anyone
typed as a tag: ``<next-version>.dev<n>+g<sha>`` (e.g. ``4.0.1.dev3+gabc1234``), where
``<next-version>`` is its best guess at the version the *next* tag will carry. parse_version() below
accepts that shape too, purely for comparing a running dev build's own __version__ against the
latest published release -- a GitHub Release's tag_name is never itself a dev version.

This is a "nice to have", not something any tool call depends on: a network failure, a GitHub API
hiccup, or a malformed response must never surface as more than a logged warning. Every public
function here either returns ``None``/a best-effort cached result on failure, or (for
``fetch_latest_release`` alone) raises :class:`UpdateCheckerError`, which every other function in
this module catches internally.

The on-disk cache also records which channel (stable vs. beta) produced it, so switching the
"Receive Beta Releases" setting on or off doesn't leave the user staring at a stale result from the
other channel for up to a day.
