"""Generalized "block a worker thread on a human's choice" helper,
factored out of
web_approval_ui.py -- ``WebApprovalUI._run_card``/``_run_confirm`` are now
thin wrappers around ``block_on_card``/``block_on_confirm`` below, with no
behavior change ("Done when": no behavior change to approvals).

The insight: a worker thread blocked on a human's answer is
the same mechanism whether the answer is "accept/deny/accept_all" (a card),
"confirm/cancel" (a PII/rule confirmation), or "which of these N options"
(settings_controller.py's Atlassian multi-resource picker) -- register a
``PendingApproval`` in the one shared registry, render it as HTML, block the
calling thread on its ``threading.Event``, and read back whatever a human's
decision POST (web/routes_approvals.py's ``decide`` endpoint, unchanged)
wrote into ``result``/``chosen_index_result``. One mechanism, one set of
tests, and the picker gets the same "no longer pending" landing page an
approval link already has -- see approvals.PendingApprovalRegistry and
web/routes_approvals.py for the registration/serving/deciding side this
module sits on top of.
