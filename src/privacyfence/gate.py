"""Shared gating helper: auto-accept check -> popup -> audit log.

Every gated call resolves inside gated_call(): the data is fetched, an
auto-accept rule may skip the popup entirely, otherwise a popup shown
through the pluggable ApprovalUI seam (approval_ui.py) asks a human. Two
postures, chosen per call by whether the active ApprovalUI exposes a
``deferred_registry`` (approval_ui.py's own docstring):

- **No registry** (any ApprovalUI that has nowhere to send a human a
  reviewable link -- WebApprovalUI, the only implementation since P10
  retired NativeApprovalUI/approval_popup.py, always has one, so this path
  is dormant today but the seam still generalizes to it -- see
  approval_ui.py's own docstring): unchanged from before P3. gated_call()
  blocks until the popup returns; there is no pending-approval handshake,
  so Claude never holds a tool that can release gated data on its own.
- **A registry** (WebApprovalUI): gated_call() still resolves inline,
  identically, *if a human decides within ``registry.hold_window`` seconds*
  (default 30s -- D3). If not, it returns a structured
  ``{"status": "approval_pending", "approval_id", "url", ...}`` result
  instead of continuing to block. The human interaction keeps
  running in the background; when it concludes, the outcome lands in
  approvals.py's decision ledger, keyed by ``(connector, tool,
  canonical(args))``. Claude re-issuing the identical tool call finds that
  ledger entry (``_resolve_decision``'s consume_ledger() check, below,
  which every call -- deferred or not -- makes first) and releases the data
  without a second prompt. There is still no tool that takes an
  ``approval_id`` and returns content: the only path to data is the
  original gated call, replayed with identical arguments, exactly as before
  -- see approvals.py's own module docstring for the full protocol and why
  the security invariant survives it unchanged.

``_popup_lock`` (this module's own, pre-P3: one dialog serialized at a
time, and the "was this already covered by a rule created while queued?"
re-check that ran under it) is gone. Job 1 -- one screen, one dialog -- is
simply obsolete for the web surface, whose whole point is several
approvals pending at once; the
native approval surface that used to keep its own, separate serialization
lock was retired at P10 (§12, D6), so there is no longer a second dialog
host to reconcile this module's own concurrency model against. Job 2
survives as an explicit re-check at the top of each
gate's interaction (see each branch's own ``_interact`` closure), for
whichever request happens to still be mid-interaction when a rule changes,
plus the rules-changed re-evaluation broadcast
(approvals.PendingApprovalRegistry.reevaluate_all(), subscribed below) for
anything that's already moved into the pending/registry state.

  gate="review"  (read tools)
    Popup offers Deny / Allow once / and — for every plausible auto-accept
    rule that can be derived from the item's attributes — an Always allow
    button, one per candidate (auto_accept.suggest_rule_choices()). Most
    operations only ever have one candidate, so this is a single button; the
    four operations in auto_accept.SUGGESTION_FAMILIES can match 2+ rules on
    the same item and render one button each. Clicking any of them proposes
    (with a second confirmation dialog) a standing rule for similar future
    reads.

  gate="popup"   (write tools)
    Popup offers Deny / Allow once by default. Auto-accepting writes
    silently is a materially bigger blast radius than auto-accepting reads,
    so Always allow is not offered on most write popups. Two narrow, opt-in
    exceptions to that rule, each scoped to avoid reopening it wholesale:

    - A small set of operations expected to be called repeatedly against
      the same file in quick succession (see
      auto_accept.TEMP_ACCEPT_ELIGIBLE_OPERATIONS) get a lighter-weight
      concession instead of a standing Always allow rule: clicking Allow
      once on one of these also auto-accepts further calls of the same
      operation against that same file for 5 minutes, in memory only
      (never written to settings.yaml, gone on daemon restart). Clicking
      Allow once on one of these operations arms this grace window
      automatically -- the popup discloses it with a plain caption
      (approval_window_html.py's temp_accept_eligible), not a separate control.
    - A separate, small set of operations that already have a
      resource-identity-scoped auto-accept rule (see
      auto_accept.WRITE_RULE_SUGGESTIONS -- one Gmail label, one calendar,
      one Jira project, one Confluence space, one Tasks list; never a bare
      "accept every future write of this type" toggle) get an actual
      Always allow button, proposing that rule scoped to the item just
      acted on -- the same second-confirmation-dialog flow the review
      branch already uses, reused here rather than reinvented.

    See the popup-gate branch below for where both actually get armed.

PII gate: read tools only (``gate="review"``). Before any auto-accept check,
the scan text (``pii_scan_text`` if the caller provided one, otherwise the
same ``details`` shown in the popup) is scanned by pii_detector.py for
likely Hungarian/English/German personal data. A match overrides a matching
auto-accept rule — the call is routed to the normal interactive popup
regardless — which is then tinted, and after the user clicks Allow once (or
Always allow), one more explicit "Are you sure?" dialog is required before the
decision is finalized. Declining it is treated the same as denying the
original request. Auto-accept rules are typically scoped to metadata (sender
domain, folder, "I am the organizer") rather than content, so a rule that
would silently pass through PII-bearing content still gets a human in the
loop for that specific item.

Write tools (``gate="popup"``) never run this real scan: the gate exists to
catch personal data flowing from an external source into Claude's context,
and a write is normally content Claude itself already generated going the
other way, to a tool Claude already described in chat -- there's no external
PII to intercept on that side. ``write_content_flags`` (below) is a
deliberately weaker, informational-only signal for the general write case.

PII-refinement trial capture, opt-in and off by default (pii_detection.
audit_match_details in settings.yaml -- see pii_detector.
is_pii_audit_match_details_enabled()): every audit entry always records
*which* category(ies) pii_detector.py flagged (``pii_categories`` --
category labels only, same thing the popup banner already shows, so this
part is always on). When the trial setting is also on, the entry's
``pii_match_details`` additionally carries the literal matched text (or a
redacted form for a value-bearing category -- see pii_detector.
describe_match_for_audit()) for a request that was actually approved, or a
fixed "details hidden" placeholder -- never the matched text -- for one
that wasn't. See _pii_match_details_for_audit() and AuditEntry's own
docstring in audit_log.py for the full contract.

One narrow, deliberate exception: ``upload_pii_scan_text``, only ever set by
drive_upload_file. Its payload (an arbitrary local file via ``local_path``,
or inline bytes via ``content_base64``) breaks the "Claude already generated
this" premise above -- it can be content Claude never read at all. When set,
this runs the same real scan (``upload_pii_categories``) and the same forced
second confirmation (``_confirm_pii_or_deny``) the read side gets, gated
strictly to this one operation rather than reopening "writes get the PII
gate" as a general rule.

A second, narrower exception on the *read* side: ``pii_already_reviewed``, set
by a caller that can prove the exact content behind this read is content
PrivacyFence itself wrote to this same file, still completely unchanged
since -- e.g. drive_get_file_content reading back a Google Doc whose Drive
``modifiedTime`` still matches the value recorded right after PrivacyFence's
own last write to it (see connectors/drive.py's ``own_write_revisions``).
``pii_categories`` still feeds the audit log's ``pii_detected`` field
faithfully either way; this only suppresses the forced second confirmation,
on the theory that a human already saw this exact content in the write's own
approval popup and re-confirming it on every subsequent re-read is pure
friction, not an extra safety check. The instant anything else modifies the
file -- a human collaborator, another app, a different Claude session --
``modifiedTime`` no longer matches and the very next read goes through the
ordinary PII gate again, no manual revocation needed.

Callers should pass ``pii_scan_text`` whenever a review-gate ``details_text``
mixes structural envelope metadata (an email's From/To headers, a chat
message's channel/sender, a page's author) with the actual content (body,
message text, description) -- that metadata is present on every item
regardless of what it says and will otherwise make the PII gate fire on
essentially every read. ``pii_scan_text`` should carry only the actual
content being read. Same reasoning applies to ``upload_pii_scan_text``.

# Every dialog this module shows (the approval popup itself, the PII
# confirmation, the "Always allow" rule confirmation) runs on this dedicated
# executor rather than asyncio.to_thread's default pool. That default pool
# (min(32, cpu_count + 4) workers) is shared with every connector's own
# blocking I/O (asyncio.to_thread wraps every *_client.py call the same way
# -- see connectors/slack.py's _fetch for one example). A handful of slow
# calls -- Slack's rate-limit retry sleeping out a Retry-After window is the
# one this was written for -- can occupy every worker in that shared pool,
# so giving popups their own dedicated lane connector I/O can never fill
# still matters regardless of worker count.
#
# max_workers used to be 1, because gate.py's own _popup_lock (removed at
# P3 -- see module docstring) already serialized every dialog to one at a
# time, so a second worker would have sat idle. It's several now because
# that's no longer true for the web surface: several approvals showing at
# once is P3's whole point ("New coalescing case" / "Job 1... obsolete").
#
# Sized against approvals.DEFAULT_MAX_PENDING, not a literal worker count:
# every approval the registry considers "live" needs a worker parked on it
# for the whole time it's undecided (a worker blocks on an Event, not a
# compute budget -- cheap to over-provision), and a card past whatever this
# pool's size is renders as web/routes_approvals.py's "Preparing this
# request" placeholder until one frees up, forever, if the registry can
# hold more approvals live than this pool has workers for. Tying the two
# together here means a future change to one default can't silently
# reintroduce that stall in the other. daemon_main.py calls
