"""PrivacyFence daemon: persistent background process that owns credentials,
connectors, and the embedded web approval/config UI.

Started at login (LaunchAgent on macOS: com.privacyfence.app.plist), or
automatically by Claude Desktop's ``.mcpb`` shim on first use. Only one
instance is allowed (enforced via a lock file). Claude reaches this process
over the embedded ``/mcp`` Streamable HTTP endpoint (see
web/mcp_dispatch.py's module docstring) -- the original bridge/IPC-socket
transport was retired at P5; ``connector_host.py``'s ``ConnectorHost`` is what's left of
``ipc_server.py``'s own role once the socket and its dispatch logic are
gone. A human reaches it the same way: over the embedded web approval/
settings surfaces (``/approvals``, and ``/settings`` when
``web.settings.enabled``) -- through P9 there was also a native macOS
AppKit UI (a menu bar tray icon, native approval dialogs, a native webview
settings window); P10 deleted all of it (§12, decision D6 in §15: "two
approval surfaces means two places for a security fix to land"), so the
web surface is now the only one, on every platform this process runs on.

Threading model:
  - Main thread:   waits on ``_wait_for_shutdown()`` (below) until
    ``request_shutdown()`` is called (the web settings page's "Quit
    PrivacyFence" action) or the process receives SIGINT/Ctrl-C -- there is
    no run loop of its own to host anymore, since every Claude-facing and
    human-facing surface already runs on the web thread below.
  - Web thread:    uvicorn serving the embedded HTTP server (web/server.py)
    that hosts ``/mcp`` and the web approval/settings surfaces -- this is
    also the event loop every connector call now actually runs on.
  - Update timer:  a background thread pulsing ``SettingsController.
    on_update_check_timer()`` every few hours (see
    UPDATE_CHECK_TIMER_INTERVAL_SECONDS below) -- the direct successor of
    the old menu bar's own ``rumps.Timer``.
  - Cache warm:    short-lived background thread(s) started right after the
    web server's event loop is known, refreshing Slack/Telegram directory
    caches if they've gone stale -- see _warm_connector_caches(). Kept off
    the main thread so a large workspace/account doesn't delay startup.

Configuration is split into two files (see paths.py):
  - ``org/org_config.json``    — organization-level app registrations (Google
    OAuth client, Slack app, Salesforce Connected App, Atlassian OAuth app),
    installed via PrivacyFence Settings (``/settings``, or by hand-editing
    this file). Optional per service; a connector is offered only if its
    section is present. Telegram's api_id/api_hash are the one exception:
    they identify the PrivacyFence app itself (not an organization) and are
    baked into the release build — see app_credentials.py. Also carries
    ``unattended_sessions.enabled`` — a deliberate per-organization opt-in,
    not a per-user setting, so it lives here rather than settings.yaml.
    ``rooms`` (optional) is a static room/resource directory snapshot IT
    refreshes with ``scripts/sync_room_directory.py``, using a separate,
    admin-scoped Google Cloud project — see that script's module docstring
    and docs/google-cloud-setup.md. It's plain data, not a credential, and is
    handed straight to CalendarConnector; the Calendar OAuth client itself
    never carries Workspace-admin directory scope. ``mode``/``server``/
    ``idp`` (P7) switch this daemon into org mode — a real OAuth 2.1 authorization
    server on ``/mcp`` instead of the local shared-secret token, human
    identity resolved via the org's own OIDC IdP. Absent (every install
    before this phase, and every one that hasn't opted in) means local
    mode, byte-identical to before. See org_mode.py and org_identity.py
    for the schema, or build a bundle with ``scripts/build_org_bundle.py
    --mode org ...``.
  - ``config/settings.yaml``   — per-user settings: privacy policy,
    connectors{enabled}, auto_accept_rules,
    pii_detection{enabled, detect_ip_addresses, detect_financial_figures,
    audit_match_details}, step_up{enabled, scope, rp_id, rp_name,
    require_passkey} (#426 Phase 1 -- local mode's own WebAuthn passkey
    enrollment config, see step_up_config.py). No secrets live here. Lives
    under ``paths.authority_dir()`` (#428 Phase 1), not the user-dir root
    directly -- see that function's own docstring.
Per-user credentials (OAuth tokens, Telegram session) live under
``credentials/``, one file per connector -- ``paths.user_dir()`` itself,
reachable by the agent, since these are its own operational data rather
than the human's authority.

    unchanged from before this phase (there is no approval surface to fall
    back to there either, but org mode has never had a way to reach one
    without ``/mcp`` in the first place -- see ``_start_org_web_server``'s
    own docstring). ``web.mcp.enabled``/``web.settings.enabled`` remain
    independent rollback levers for those two surfaces specifically --
    turning both off still leaves the server running for ``/approvals``
    alone, since P10 left that with no off switch of its own ("it deletes
    the fallback"). Since P5 retired
    the bridge, turning ``mcp.enabled`` off also leaves this install with
    no way for Claude to reach it at all -- ``web.mcp.enabled: true``
    (settings.yaml.example's default since D11/P4b) is no longer "additive
    alongside the bridge", it is the only transport there is; the key
    survives as a deliberate full-stop kill switch, not as a rollback to
    some other still-working path. Imports the web/starlette/uvicorn/mcp
    stack lazily so constructing it is deferred to the one place that
    actually needs it, same posture this module has taken since P1.

    ``connector_host`` is already built and holds the real connector set by
    the time this is called (see run_app's ordering) -- the MCP dispatcher
    polls ``connector_host.connectors`` live rather than taking its own
    snapshot, so a connector rebuild pushed by SettingsController.
    refresh_connectors (-> ConnectorHost.set_connectors) reaches the
    ``/mcp`` endpoint too, with nothing here needing a second push. Note
    that this connector set is the *local* principal's own (org mode's
    real per-user connectors are P8's job, per docs/https-connector-
    refactor-plan.md's own phase dependency chart -- P7 delivers identity,
    P8 the per-user service authorization that makes a second principal's
    connectors buildable at all); every principal authenticated via org
    mode's OAuth 2.1 AS dispatches against this same shared connector set
    until then.

    ``controller``, when given, is the SettingsController instance
    run_app() built for this daemon's whole lifetime -- passed through here
    so the web settings page (when ``web.settings.enabled``) can drive it;
    always the same instance regardless, so a rule changed via ``/settings``
    and one changed via a gated call's own "Always allow" button stay in
    sync with no separate plumbing.

    ``org_config`` (P7, §4) is where ``"mode"`` lives -- ``org`` switches
    this into web/server.py's own org-mode wiring (a real OAuth 2.1
    authorization server on ``/mcp``, no local-token approval/settings
    surface at all -- see that module's own docstring for why). Defaults
    to ``{}`` (local mode, byte-identical to before this phase) when
    omitted, which no real caller does -- run_app() always passes the
    result of ``load_org_config()``.

    """Load ``settings.yaml`` for whichever principal is currently scoped,
    and make it *live* for that principal -- three halves of what run_app()
    does once for the local principal (auto-accept rules, and, since #400's
    Phase 0 fix, the privacy/PII filter too).

    Called from org mode's per-principal ``ConnectorRegistry`` factory,
    under the ``principal_scope`` that factory is already run inside. The
    *relative* path is what makes ``_resolve_authority_path()`` (and
    ``load_config``'s own bootstrap-a-default-on-first-use behavior)
    resolve against that principal's own
    ``users/<id>/authority/config/settings.yaml`` rather than the local
    principal's, per §9.2's storage layout and #428 Phase 1's authority
    split.

    All three side effects below exist because ``ConnectorRegistry.get()``
    never goes through ``run_app()`` for any principal other than local, so
    nothing else ever performs them for an org principal:

    - ``init_config_path()`` -- without it, every non-local principal's
      ``auto_accept._REGISTRY`` entry kept its default ``config_path=None``
      forever. Invisible until something actually tried to *persist* a
      rule/grant for that principal -- ``add_auto_accept_rule``/
      ``mutate_grants`` (gate.propose_rule_change's "Always allow"/
      propose-rule-change paths) would raise "auto_accept config path not
      initialized" instead.
    - ``reload_rules(build_effective_rules(cfg))`` -- without it, that
      principal's ``_AutoAcceptState.instance`` stayed ``None``, so
      ``get_auto_accept_evaluator()`` lazily built an
      ``AutoAcceptEvaluator({})``: an empty rule set, permanently, no
      matter what that principal's ``settings.yaml`` actually said on disk.
      Every configured auto-accept rule and resource grant was silently
      inert in org mode -- ``gate.py``'s real ``should_auto_accept()`` sent
      every call to a human popup, and ``privacyfence_check_policy``
      reported "No auto-accept rule is configured for this operation" for
      operations that plainly had one (``privacyfence_list_auto_accept_rules``,
      which reads ``get_current_config()`` straight from disk rather than
      the evaluator, kept showing the rule the whole time -- that
      disagreement between the two meta-tools is the symptom this fixes).
      Fail-safe, never fail-open, but it made unattended sessions and
      auto-accept as a whole unusable for every org principal.
    - ``init_privacy_filter()`` (#400 Phase 0) -- without it, ``privacy_
      filter._REGISTRY`` (also a ``PrincipalRegistry``, see that module's
      docstring) kept its default empty-dict entry for every principal but
      whichever one happened to be scoped when a local-mode ``run_app()``
      called ``init_privacy_filter`` directly. ``category_policy()``'s own
      "group absent from the registry" fallback is a hardcoded "allow" --
      the *opposite* of org mode's intended fail-closed ``block`` default
      (``privacy_filter.init_privacy_filter``'s own ``fail_safe_default``)
      -- so every org principal but that one silently got the permissive
      default nobody configured. ``org_managed=True`` unconditionally: this
      function only ever runs from org mode's own ``ConnectorRegistry``
      factory (see this function's own docstring above), never local
      mode's. Install-wide, per the design docs/org-mode-setup-guide.md §9
      states ("there is no per-user override") -- so this uses
      ``install_wide_config`` (the server's own settings.yaml, threaded
      down from ``_start_org_web_server``), not this principal's own
      per-user ``cfg``, for exactly the same reason ``cfg`` is right for
      auto-accept rules and wrong here: a per-user file nobody expects an
      admin to edit for PII policy must not silently override the one file
      they actually do edit. Falls back to ``cfg`` only when no install-wide
      config is given at all (a bare ``principal_scope()`` call in a test
      that doesn't care about privacy-filter behavior specifically).
    - ``init_pii_detection()`` (#400 C3e) -- the exact same omission as the
      one above, one module over, found while making the PII gate editable
      from org mode's admin settings page. ``pii_detector._REGISTRY`` is a
      ``PrincipalRegistry`` too, and ``run_app()``'s own call is the only
      one there has ever been, so every org principal but the launcher's
      got a default-constructed ``_PiiState`` -- detection on, both
      optional categories on -- no matter what the install's settings.yaml
      said. Unlike the privacy-filter case that default is fail-*closed*
      (it detects more, not less), so nothing was ever let through that
      shouldn't have been; what it did mean is that an admin who turned a
      category off install-wide saw it stay on for everyone -- precisely
      the disagreement a settings page that now *edits* this value cannot
      ship with. Same install-wide source, for the same reason.

    The sibling ``init_config_path`` omission was found and fixed on its own; this one
    survived it because no in-process org test had a principal whose
    settings.yaml carried a rule *and* went through the real factory.

    mounted here too now -- see web/server.py's own module docstring for
    exactly what it does and does not cover. Raises ``org_mode.
    ConfigurationError`` (SEC-04; surfaced as a startup failure, the same
    posture a missing/invalid settings.yaml already has) if org_config.json
    is missing the ``idp``/``server`` sections org mode requires -- there is
    no silent partial-org-mode fallback.

    ``connector_host`` (the local principal's own connector set, built once
    at startup by run_app()) is accepted for signature parity with local
    mode's own call but is otherwise unused here as of P8: every org
    principal's connectors now come from ``ConnectorRegistry`` below,
    built lazily per principal instead of shared off the local principal's
    set (see connector_registry.py's own docstring for why this was left
    unwired until now).

    ``install_wide_config_path`` (#400 C3e) is where that dict came from,
    resolved -- carried on ``OrgAuth`` so the admin privacy page can write
    the policy back to the same file. Empty when a caller has no real
    settings.yaml behind the dict, which leaves that page read-only rather
    than guessing at a path to overwrite.

    ``install_wide_config`` (#400 Phase 0) is run_app()'s own ``config`` --
    the *server's own* settings.yaml, already loaded once at startup for
    the local/launcher principal's own ``init_privacy_filter()`` call.
    Threaded down into ``_connectors_for_principal``'s
    ``_load_principal_settings()`` call below (so every org principal's
    privacy-filter registry entry reflects the real install-wide policy,
    not their own unconfigured per-user file -- see that function's own
    docstring) and carried on ``OrgAuth.install_wide_settings`` for
    web/routes_org_settings.py's admin-only policy view to read directly,
    with no daemon_main import of its own needed there.
