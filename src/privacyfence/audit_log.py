"""Audit log: records every accept/deny/auto_accept decision.

Entries are appended to JSON-lines files in logs/audit/YYYY-WNN.jsonl
(one file per ISO week). A weekly Excel export (openpyxl) is generated
at daemon startup for any week that has a .jsonl but no .xlsx yet.

Each JSONL file is append-integrity protected: every entry is chained to the one
before it with a keyed hash (HMAC-SHA256, see AuditLogger._compute_entry_
hash), so a line inserted, edited, or removed after the fact -- without
also holding this install's own signing key (AuditLogger's
``.audit_chain.key``, generated on first use and never itself written
into the log it protects) -- breaks the chain in a way ``verify_chain()``
(or ``scripts/verify_audit_log.py``) detects (ADR 0071). Every entry also carries an explicit,
monotonically-increasing ``schema_version`` per entry (AuditEntry.
schema_version); a stable ``event_id`` unique to that one JSONL line
(distinct from ``request_id``, which is deliberately *shared* across a
deferred-approval's "pending" and its later "decided" entry -- see
AuditEntry.decision's own docstring); a per-install ``deployment_id``
(daemon_main.get_or_create_deployment_id()) so entries centrally
forwarded or aggregated from multiple machines/servers can be told apart;
and a per-entry ``security_config_hash`` fingerprinting the privacy
policy (settings.yaml) in effect when that decision was recorded (see
compute_security_config_hash() below). Centralized forwarding of these
entries to a syslog/SIEM/OTLP collector -- an off-host copy, for org
mode -- lives in audit_forwarding.py; AuditLogger.record() calls into it
but doesn't implement any transport itself.
