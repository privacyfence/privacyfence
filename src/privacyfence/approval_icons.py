"""Shared icon-asset loading for approval surfaces.

Locates the bundled shield/connector PNGs (resources/icon_*.png,
resources/connector_icons/<name>.png) and returns them as base64 data URIs
for embedding directly into a card-stack HTML document -- see
approval_window_html.py's module docstring for why that document must never
trigger a network fetch to render.

Plain filesystem + base64, no AppKit/PyObjC dependency -- both
approval_window.py's native host (AppKit/WKWebView) and web_approval_ui.py's
browser host need the exact same data URIs, so this is factored out here
rather than duplicated, and importable on any platform. approval_window.py
keeps its own private _icon_path/_connector_icon_path/_icon_data_uri (not
migrated onto this module) so this change stays scoped to the new web
surface without touching the native path's own, separately-tested code.
