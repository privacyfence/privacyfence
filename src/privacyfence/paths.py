"""Centralized path resolution for PrivacyFence.

lives in the project root. In a bundled .app, or a real (non-editable)
``pip``/``pipx install privacyfence``: data lives under a per-user data
directory so it survives app updates/reinstalls -- see is_bundled() and
_is_installed_package(). On POSIX that's ``~/.privacyfence``; on Windows
it's ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\PrivacyFence`` -- see windows_data_dir() for why
that's a different convention rather than the same dotfile name reused
under ``%USERPROFILE%``.
