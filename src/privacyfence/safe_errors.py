"""Sanitization at the boundary between an internal exception and anything
that leaves the process -- an MCP tool-call error result handed back to the
client, or a line written to the local log file.

Passing ``str(exc)`` straight into a client-visible response or a log line
(``routes_mcp.py``'s ``handle_call_tool``, ``idp_callback``) would be
unsafe. Most of what flows through a
``raise SomeError(...)`` in this codebase is written by us and carries
nothing sensitive (``f"Unknown tool: {tool!r}"``, ``"Request denied by
user"``), but plenty of it isn't: every connector's own ``*ClientError``
(gmail_client.py and friends) routinely wraps a third-party HTTP client's
own exception text via ``f"... failed: {exc}"``, and the OAuth modules
(google_oauth.py, atlassian_oauth.py) have at least one call site that
stringifies an entire token-exchange response dict into an error message --
exactly the kind of text that can carry a bearer token, an authorization
code, or a refresh token.

Complication a first pass misses: that wrapped, untrustworthy text doesn't
reach ``handle_call_tool`` as a ``*ClientError`` -- every connector's own
``_fetch``-style helper (see e.g. connectors/gmail.py) already catches its
``*ClientError`` and re-raises ``RuntimeError(str(exc))``, per
docs/coding-and-testing-guidelines.md §2.7's own "new connector code
catches it and re-raises as RuntimeError" rule. So a plain ``RuntimeError``
is, by a repo-wide convention older than this fix, exactly the type that
*does* carry arbitrary wrapped text -- while ``gate.py``'s own denial
raises (``"Request denied by user"`` and friends) are composed only of
static text. Were both plain ``RuntimeError``, the same builtin type would
carry two very different trust levels, indistinguishable by ``isinstance``
alone. This module resolves that by giving every self-authored "denied, not failed" raise site
its own named ``RuntimeError`` subclass instead (``gate.GateDeniedError``;
``approvals.TooManyPendingApprovalsError``,
``connector_registry.TooManyPrincipalsError``) and having
``public_message()`` below trust a *named* subclass but not the bare
``RuntimeError`` class itself -- so a connector's wrapped failure still
falls through to the generic message, and a future call site gets the
right trust level by construction the moment it reaches for a named type
instead of bare ``RuntimeError(...)``.

Two independent layers, matching the two places that text can leak:

* ``public_message()`` -- a *typed* allowlist. An exception type this
  module doesn't recognise as "self-authored, never carries third-party
  text" gets a fixed, generic message; nothing about its actual content is
  trusted enough to forward, redacted or not -- regex-based secret
  detection is necessarily incomplete (see ``redact_secrets``'s own
  docstring), so a type it hasn't reviewed doesn't get the benefit of the
  doubt. This is what a client-facing boundary (routes_mcp.py's
  ``handle_call_tool``) uses for whatever reaches the caller.
* ``redact_secrets()`` / ``SecretRedactingFormatter`` -- applied to the
  *detailed* diagnostic that still goes to the local log file, for every
  exception, not just the allowlisted ones, so a real secret that does make
  it into a log line is scrubbed there too rather than relying on the
  allowlist alone. Installed once, on the root logger, by
  ``daemon_main.setup_logging`` -- every logger in the process inherits it.

``public_message()`` also runs its result through ``redact_secrets()``
before returning it: defense in depth, not a substitute for the allowlist
-- an allowlisted type's message is expected to already be safe, but
nothing stops a future edit from interpolating something it shouldn't.

    available -- to an operator, not this caller -- in the local log.

    One narrower rule inside that allowlist (see this module's docstring):
    an exception whose type is *exactly* ``RuntimeError`` -- not a named

    being on the allowlist. That's the type every connector's own
