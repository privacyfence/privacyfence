"""Per-principal connector registry (P6's "Connectors become per-principal
too" paragraph).

``connector_host.py``'s ``ConnectorHost`` holds one process-wide
``{name: Connector}`` map, built once by ``daemon_main.build_connectors()``
at daemon startup -- correct for local mode, where there is exactly one
principal for the life of the process. Org mode needs a *set* of these, one
per principal, built lazily (a principal's connectors can't exist before
that principal has authorized the underlying services -- P8) and evicted
when idle, since "N users x up to 12 authenticated API clients" is "the
main memory-scaling question."

``ConnectorRegistry`` is that: a lazy, bounded, principal-keyed cache of
``ConnectorHost`` instances. P6 built it but deliberately did **not** wire it
into daemon_main.py's own single-process boot sequence -- that still built
exactly one ``ConnectorHost`` for the local principal directly, unchanged,
which is what kept local mode byte-identical (P6's own exit criterion). This
class was the seam a later phase's real per-request serving would plug into
once there's a second principal whose connectors can actually be built: P7
supplied the identity, P8 the per-user service authorization that makes a
second principal's connectors
buildable at all.

**P8 wires this in.** ``daemon_main.py``'s ``_start_org_web_server`` now
builds one ``ConnectorRegistry`` per daemon and the ``/mcp`` dispatcher's
``connectors_provider`` becomes ``lambda: registry.get(current_principal()).
connectors`` -- ``local`` mode's own single ``ConnectorHost``, built once at
startup for the local principal, is completely unaffected (this class is
still never touched on that path). ``web/routes_connect.py``'s OAuth
callback route calls ``evict(principal.id)`` right after writing a new
service token, so the very next call for that principal rebuilds its
connector set instead of waiting out ``idle_evict_seconds``.

``factory`` is meant to be a thin wrapper around
``daemon_main.build_connectors(config, org_config)`` -- ``build_connectors``
itself doesn't need to change *its connector-building logic* for this to
work correctly per-principal, because every path it resolves through (token
files via ``_resolve_path``, the Slack/Telegram cache files) now goes
through ``paths.user_dir()``, which resolves against whichever principal
``ConnectorRegistry.get()`` below has entered via ``principal_scope`` at the
time ``factory`` runs -- see paths.py's own ``user_dir()`` and
daemon_main.py's ``_resolve_path``. (Issue #396 Phase 1 did add a second
return value, a per-connector failure-reason map -- ``factory`` itself is
still just ``list[Connector]``, so daemon_main.py's own
``_connectors_for_principal`` unpacks and discards that map; see its
docstring for why org mode has nowhere to surface it yet.)
