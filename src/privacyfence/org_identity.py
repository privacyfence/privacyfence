"""Org identity: OIDC against the organization's IdP (ADR 0011).

PrivacyFence never asks a human for a password of its own. Every org-mode
sign-in -- whether it's a browser visiting ``/login`` (web/routes_org_
identity.py) or Claude's own OAuth 2.1 dance completing through the org
authorization server (web/oauth_provider.py's ``OrgOAuthProvider``) -- goes
through the exact same four functions below: build an authorization URL,
exchange the code the IdP redirects back with, verify the ID token it
returns, and turn its claims into a ``Principal``. That's deliberate: ADR
0011's "the browser session and the MCP token are then provably the same
identity" argument only holds if both paths resolve identity
through literally the same code, not two implementations that happen to
agree today.

This module talks to the IdP with the same posture every other connector's
OAuth flow in this codebase already has (``oauth_loopback.py``,
``atlassian_oauth.py``, ...): synchronous ``requests`` calls, a handful of
them, never on a hot path. Callers on the ASGI event loop (web/oauth_
provider.py, web/routes_org_identity.py) run them via ``asyncio.to_thread``,
the same pattern gate.py already uses for every blocking connector call
(see that module's own comments on why).
