"""Approval UI seam: the interface gate.py depends on instead of importing
a concrete approval-surface implementation directly.

gate.py is the policy engine: auto-accept check -> block on a human decision
-> audit log. The policy loop itself has no reason to know how a human
decision actually gets shown -- it just needs something that can show the
write-gate popup, the review-gate popup, and the two smaller confirmation
dialogs, and return a decision. ApprovalUI is that something.

WebApprovalUI (web_approval_ui.py, the card stack served over HTTP) is
the sole implementation: two approval surfaces would mean two places for a
security fix to land (ADR 0001). The ABC stays here, and gate.py still
reaches it through get_approval_ui() rather than importing WebApprovalUI
directly, on purpose: the seam is what lets a native surface come back if
one-implementation proves wrong, so a future implementation (e.g. a
platform-native dialog) only needs to implement this interface and call
init_approval_ui() with an
instance of it -- gate.py's own call sites never change.
