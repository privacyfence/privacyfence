"""Name resolution for auto-accept rule values (see policy/resource_registry.py).

The Auto-accept Settings page shows a rule's value by ID (the ground truth the engine matches on)
but should *display* the resource's real name — a folder name, a task list name, a channel name —
not the opaque ID. This module resolves an ID to a name via the relevant connector's own read API
(each ``GrantResourceType`` in policy/resource_registry.py declares its own ``resolver``), and
caches the result so the page doesn't hit the network on every rebuild and still has something
to show immediately after a cold start, before any connector has
reconnected this session.

Two cache layers:
  - in-memory, short TTL — avoids re-resolving on every menu rebuild
    (``_rebuild()`` in menu_bar.py can fire fairly often: config changes,
    connector auth, rule hot-reload).
  - on-disk, no TTL — best-effort "last known name", so a name is available
    the instant the menu is built after a daemon restart, before any
    connector has been re-authenticated this session. Never authoritative;
    a resolution failure never blocks or changes an auto-accept decision,
    it only affects what a menu label says.

Resolution never makes a network call beyond what the connector is already
authorized for (it calls the same client methods used elsewhere in the
daemon), and only when a live, already-authenticated client is available.
