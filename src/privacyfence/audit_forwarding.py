"""Forward each audit-log entry to a centralized syslog server or a generic
HTTP/webhook log collector, for org mode.

Before this, org mode's audit log (docs/security-and-compliance.md's own,
formerly accurate, description) was "a local file on that server, not
forwarded anywhere (e.g. to a SIEM)" -- an organization that wanted its
audit trail to survive a compromise of the daemon's own host, or to feed an
existing SIEM/log pipeline, had nothing to plug into. This module is the
off-host copy of the audit trail; ``audit_log.py``'s per-entry HMAC hash
chain is the on-host half (append-integrity for the local file itself).

Design:
  - **Best-effort, off the decision path.** ``audit_log.AuditLogger.record()``
    -- the local JSONL write -- is always the durable record of a decision;
    forwarding never blocks it and a forwarding failure never loses or
    delays a gate decision. ``AuditForwarder`` below runs one small
    background thread pulling off a bounded queue; a full queue or a send
    failure is logged at ``warning`` and that entry is dropped from the
    *forwarded* stream only -- it is already safely on disk locally, via the
    hash chain, regardless of whether this ever ships anywhere else.
  - **Two transports**, chosen per org via ``org_mode.AuditForwardingConfig``:
      - ``syslog``: RFC 5424 formatted messages, RFC 6587 octet-counting
        framing for TCP (so an embedded newline in the JSON body can never
        be mistaken for a message boundary). TLS is deliberately NOT
        implemented here -- the documented pattern (matching
        org-mode-setup-guide.md's own "a reverse proxy terminates TLS, this
        daemon speaks plaintext behind it" posture for HTTPS) is to point
        this at a local relay (stunnel, syslog-ng/rsyslog with a
        TLS-terminating listener bound to ``127.0.0.1``) rather than
        reimplementing TLS-over-syslog by hand for one Python module.
      - ``http``: a plain HTTPS POST of one JSON object per entry, with an
        optional bearer token read from an environment variable at send
        time (never stored in ``org_config.json`` -- see
        ``AuditForwardingConfig.http_bearer_token_env``'s own docstring).
        This is deliberately NOT a full OTLP SDK -- it's a generic
        JSON-over-HTTPS webhook, which is what most "OTLP-over-HTTP/JSON"
        log receivers and SIEM HTTP-intake endpoints (Splunk HEC, Datadog's
        Logs API, an Elastic ingest pipeline, a custom collector) actually
        expect on the wire. Point it at whichever of those your real
        collector exposes.
